patel died before independent india even had its first elections for lok sabha and more importantly india exception and outlier among the newly independent former colonies the europeans having your leaded dead within year getting sovereignty recipe for following the vein other examples list which too long and regarding pok there have been multiple instances where india had the casus belli taking but couldn wouldn the idea could have been done patel without any implications the sort fiction which makes you question the aptitude the person saying esp they are high office ,1
nehru dead the responsibility modi safeguard the security interests our nation not blame person for your ineffiency dealing with militancy pitting sardar against nehru for personal gains something one should ashamed there has been incredible rise militancy after the bjp pdp alliance came power pretty much concerned how the foreign policy shaping one side have chinese incursions regularly and the other side have pakistan countries like sri lanka nepal bangladesh and maldives may become pawns chinese govt does not act there use making friendship with usa russia when the neighbours the vicinity are problematic media and analysts say modi has performed great foreign policy but ground realities say are vulnerable position right now ,1

 says that india continues fight with pakistan over muslim majority territories you can say want the land but not the people ,0
 believe was patel himself who insisted that the maharaja kashmir sign the acquiescence pledge india before the indian army went into kashmir resulting delay few days which allowed pakistan make significant gains into indian kashmir territory nehru wanted right away with commitments from the king also patel was happy give kashmir pakistan and believed that muslim majority region bordering pakistan was the rightful claimant only changed his position after pakistan laid claim junagadh nehru wanted kashmir part india from the very beginning and fought hard for source guha india after gandhi assuming remembering correctly ,1

 state and revolution was the last book that bhagat singh ever read before his final march the gallows lenin one the few historical figures the left who rightly earns historical plaudits and respect from all sides the ideological spectrum because his sheer impact human history had stalin not corrupted and betrayed what lenin had began the world would very different place today ,1

that just bad friend others have said you can rewatch cutscenes the inn alternatively you can make new character levels isn much and play through another zone starting quests the starting quests differ for limsa gridania and dah ,-1
the story the game worth watching and reading try not skip any even the side quest are interesting times ,1
now realize why general consensus the against taking down statues confederate generals have sympathies for lenin but still don support taking down his statues reeks vindictiveness ,-1
well your friend kinda right most the story arr pretty bad doesn get good until that point with the sultana ,1
you not that far the game honestly say you should just start over and watch the cutscenes from the beginning totally worth opinion ,1
 the lore train realm reborn part what you want read the dah part notice however that this contains most likely information about later events than where you are now you should stop when you get part where you cannot recollect that you done ,1
itt people directly supporting vandalism ,1
stick with the story and you’ make plenty better friends anybody who tells you rush through something completely one sided and selfish their motivation get you play—and that’ really not fair since you’ paying and the one playing this character ,-1
alternative for your friend instead pressuring others into degraded experience make new character and join them their journey ,1
 you going watch story you kind your friend and let them know you gonna while ,1
 games are usually best known for story and tbh your friend quite rude force you skip others may fine with but you should make your own decision for this won blame you seeing you new but pretty sure you gotten the hint from all the replies here that you should not this anymore start viewing cutscenes and take all the time you need read the dialogue and listen the voice acting you enjoy that yes your friend could make that argument that you can view the cutscenes later back your personal inn room but the context totally totally lost because you just standing there that spot viewing cutscene after another you didn get enjoy the moment where you finished fighting some bad dude helped someone something else and got rewarded with immediate cutscene highly recommended enjoy msq your own pace and tell your friend that reddit says whatever reasoning gives and any consolation don worry the dinner part where the story starts get interesting lots great events heavensward and stormblood await you ,1
 put bluntly tell your friend fuck off ,-1
the uldah beginning plot kinda all over the place but essentially show that the city corrupt like the captain the brass blades cooperating with bandits along the way you meet young lalafell named lilira who has saved and you end meeting thancred together you defeat monster and find strange small blue crystal and see vision grand crystal you are later contacted sultansworn group elites loyal the sultana about the stolen crown and end fight with the bandits and get assistance from the sultansworn after the bandits are defeated the sultansworns leaves and you are suddenly attacked ascian unknown mage grand power thancred comes and helps you defeat the summoned monsters and the ascian thank you for your help you are invited banquet celebration your deeds and meet raubahn the general the immortal flames group and the sultana who was lilira disguise and there you get vision the grand crystal again something that thancred takes note off now you are sent off the other big cities envoy diplomacy ,1
 would recommend not skipping the story this game opinion the story big part why you are playing this and not wow the negative side that all cutscenes together for main story alone will add lot time your path endgame content but you will most likely level only once from absolute zero ,1
nonono your friend the story this game really good you can make more friends once you reach end game stress ,1
nice ,1
just show this reddit post your friend should know better when saying stuff like this,1
there are some people you just can touch some states periyar the doyen dravidian politics social and political activist and much loved figure not single politician will say shit about periyar matter what their party affiliation will interesting see what the bjp will distance themselves not because not just their future but also their alliances the state are dependent their reaction ,1
 others have said through the story your own pace things will unlock quickly enough you continue the main story and poke any blue marked quests you see sometimes meander but for the most part this final fantasy game and story and characters are important that interest you you long way from endgame unless you buy story and class jump potions off the online store play you like level syncing means your friends can still join you dungeons and other instanced content the journal where your quests are found has completed button where you can read summaries the quests this very detailed the early content also the inn room the unending journey will show you many but not all the cutscenes again several important ones like the banquet with the sultana and raubahn are there some quests they only replay one two other times for major quests they may give you the option replay them all you think you missed something before logging out the events tab your chatlog and default that should have most the npc dialogue you gone through that session like add npc announcements and the echo that tab too again there are some special dialogues texts that don appear anything white text with speech bubbles during some cinematic scenes but most things are there until you log out you can use the little cogwheel next the chat tabs adjust the background opacity and text color needed well any other preferences ,1

have you done any video articles where you praise sanghis lambasted the congress the opposition felt your interview with aap minister was too deferential though like the civility tbh doubts can raised about your impartiality that you don hold all politicians the same standard side note like the anti government stance here except with seemingly random downvoting bjp critical posts before some critical elections when cells have the funds hire extra staff but don want this place become critical bjp all the time and extension apologists for aap congress ,-1

maybe they have different priorities now that they attained success don like their newer stuff but hoping this just phase too early count them out you want more social commentary check out eic outrage duthjjpoxjw list plox1kfmm75bzucg7nbj u7q6ik abcoti they started uploading new videos ,1
aib just year old company they are still figuring out stuff know that they keep dropping cringe worthy videos like the recent memes had exams one every now and then but they keep making good videos also they have excellent political show called air with aib which par with other political comedians like varun grover sanjay rajoura kunal kamra karunesh talwar etc the problem with aib that they made amazing content 2014 and peaked too early but hopeful that their new web series gormint amazon prime will quite good ,1
what have been observing that they reusing their format the point which every video doesn seem unique like before the are being drawn the realm stereotypical channels that the same just cash views like amit bhadana etc basically vines clones terms new content eic has been doing good recently they try their best showcase opinions counter politicians support unpopular opinion and course criticize the media with that said hope that aib realizes this would great someone screenshot this post and get aib via twitter dont know how twitter works ,1
they are launching new show with amazon prime called gormint starring irfan khan political satire show similar veep they are also launching another show prime bringing more comics from different parts the country they just started their second aib draft training more writers and giving them platform wouldn call them trash but yeah there content very hit and miss ,1
bjp mukt maharashtra very soon,1
 preference order now kunal aib tvf tvf particularly has been quite shit their subtle modi fangiri anti ravish attitude something but tvf chaps can act their script off late has been quite weak think aib still quite political and funny their memes still are anti establishment ,-1
sng has really become the next big thing indian comedy,1
aib just hitting the right spot now has realized that comedy needs with political awareness enlighten those youths misguided our supreme leader mudiji way aib hope you don get loyaed tanmay ,1
true except kunal kamra seems refreshing ,1
there guy called carryminati though ,0
 once posted comment like tanmay butt you reading this bhai sannyas man you wouldn believe this guy who came out the shadows she was like bro apne baap basement baithke uske against kyun comment rha hai bro tera aukat kya hai was like muaf kar bhai hum opinion bhi nhi rakhenge posted this before obligatory repost ,0
now they are more interested criticising namo and making leftist statements ,1
 find rahul subramanian funny now find the office spycam sn3cpb6ps2m 355s one particularly funny ,1
 seems these guys are moving too much into bollywood and bollywood has started aping them there isn anything indie about them anymore too professional and mainstream personally don think just about having the meme generation the target audience more about how make max money with minimum risk their earlier videos were progressive but takes effort without lot renumeration educate people easier get alia guest appearance and grab eyeballs that way won surprised the four eventually end becoming full time bollywood actors and give the comedy scene almost entirely pander the stereotype shaming audience south delhi girls every punjabi ever etc and give the harder stuff aib could have been much more but speaks lot about indian society that everything eventually ends bollywood and bollywood consumes everything ,1
yeah cuz aib now conglomerate other writers some girls who are just peddling content make kids happy course gonna shit there truth but hey stopped watching aib somewhere around the irfan khan video gut told was going downhill,1
 think they have careful with their videos don doubt that they want make edgier content but after what happened with roast they know every video theirs being monitored closely,-1
for comedy watch fugget bout youtube ,0
aditi mittal the shit,-1
reminds what happened collegehumor,0
humor subjective ,0
aib was always mediocre ,-1
did you see the fellowkids material they posted recently called something like ‘ memes had exams’ ,0
any thoughts eic really like their outrage series light comedy with news ,1
when something becomes mainstream the tendency appeal the layman increases explains why movie like grand masti can mint 100 crores without superstars but movie like talaash can ,1
well did work there for months ,0
can anyone recommend good youtube channels for comedy,1
all the comments are very well thought here are criticizing the best comedians from the indian side and aib has yes made great videos the past but they must have been really upset after putting great efforts and seeing the epitome bad indian comedy amit bhadana trending fetching million views days tanmay questions might actually had point and they are still their early 30s this that point their life when they want make the most money everything about money think besides movies indians dont see consider anything entertaining enough pay for want creative funny fresh edgy and free content with the latter being the highest priority quite logical huh ,1
best saab  chutiya ,1
aib have obnoxious layer sneer all their videos they think too highly themselves ,1
our best saab narendra modi you made comedy you yourself ,1
 miss their podcasts not the recent ones the old ones uninhibited holds barred jokes,1
 suggest the lookout for their amazon series gormint guess the main reason their content isn that great nowadays because not aib per who write their sketches but the team they hired from the first draft but have high hopes from gormint fingers crossed ,1
 was trash when came and still trash same rhetorical jokes heard them years back ,0
 what you expect for comedian get ahead has push the boundaries and always rediscover how his audience has grown result them seeing new jokes but remember that aib got roasted for their roast comedians here are stuck they push the boundaries they get called the arch diocese they have deal with the fallout and suffer they need get enough power fight back which costs money which means large audience which turn means you have appeal the mass market between these positions you have most comedians hemmed now unless the comics are ready war and fight for their freedom our court system they are going constantly hit these barriers ,1
they started trying like good western comedians that got them some mileage but stay the race they had what sells indian entertainment and know thrash sells better ,1
and therefore get laughs from alternate stuff like this meta analysis one favorite standups abish just did journey joke \ as0hdhglf8i\ kunal best work patriotism and government ,1
 nibba kya hai bhai ,0
aib content slowly becoming like karan johar movies content about rich people problems they used have crude sense humour with which they addressed serious issues now mostly like convoluted videos topics and pointless vids the only time that they make some good videos they make the references and innuendos confusing that difficult understand which one the normal statement and which one the statement with the deeper meaning the gay acceptance video they are taking good topics and making like im14andthisisdeep kind material ,1
 comedians being burnt the stake how when you talking about india refeence charlie hebdo ,0
 uck them subscribe jordindian they are now ,0
aditi mittal and kunal kamra are indian comedians enjoy ,1
damn rant about not getting enough entertainment move whatever suits you and just appreciate they started doing this before was thing how does matter you can relate their videos anymore there compulsion watch them ,0
siddaramaiah hold chair ,0
imo they are their creative limits most these folks seem engineers who never wanted engineers unfortunately most smart indian students study engineering regardless their interests for understandable reasons after engineering some them back comedy etc this not the most efficient route and the lack formal training arts shows after while ,1
when your ego more than your talent this what you get ,1
 don like aib but seriously get life not like their content affecting anyone life just harmless youtube ,-1
aayush ,0
 summon tanmaybhatt could probably answer your questions better than anyone here ,1
you could ask whether they actually believe socialism not more likely just demagoguery personally think they all crooks ,-1
aib extremely snobbish clique guys who been highly overrated their podcast with ranbir validates that they should tried keep that level condescension with shahrukh each one them would been put their place ,1
aib mainstream now they were incredible upto say early 2014 especially their live shows almost felt like had hernia after the royal turds mean singing sheila jawani the style anu malik that was ootb fucking hilarious right now someone said you not their millennials love them their style echoes the meme generations way thinking but the comedy scene india fucking rich kunal kamra has excellent honest brash style that getting political undies twist you get such cool unique styles delivery like abhishek upmanyu biswa vipul goyal zakir khan and the women comedy are killing too while not fan aditi mittal she got pretty solid fan base urooj ashfaq has probably some the best dark humor comedy heard while indian comedy has much out there you just need look beyond the trending section youtube,1
 someone wants goofy and pretty unorthodox comedy burnham style check out aadar malik stand comedy musical,1
you forgot add siachin mai humare jawaan ladde hai ,0
you sell out when you mainstream ,0
 don know why but never liked most their stuff like tvf way better since most their scripts have story with aib generally tends get little cheap most the skits either about abuses other teenage humor its almost like the whatsapp and facebook videos that viral due the new indian crowd the internet top comedy content providers are tvf kunal kamra and daniel fernandes the latter two are more about podcasts right now but absolutely loving them well subtle and engaging humor ,1
aib first use make comedy now make money kinda ,1
 really liked their air with aib show their latest vid has good production value but just meh script you should also include the sub human trash that producing the comedy with fake laughs added the background one them visited college just watched this memes had exmas bjp0 4ysl90 they make irrelevant now ,1
 aib used pinnacle social commentary and pushed the boundaries political comedy india wutt ,1
aib has sold out don blame them though doing edgy comedy india bloody risky they now resorted licking bollywood ass from the edgy they went bland ,-1
 reviser was good and intelligently put the lgbt sentiment the meme exam one was super meh let not harsh though creativity never constant ,1
"constant political threats and legal cases have been known stifle creativity
",1
hey this meme has some potential ,0
 true you are now supposed like and share their stuff because they are aib rather than because their content ,1
bikinis make for bad influence our kids they will spoil our culture ,-1
biswa amazon prime special gives hope though,1
 kulcha what that,0
personal opinion feel free debate agree certified millennial thoroughly enjoyed aib before 2015 the moment they started bringing the likes mallika dua they lost their mojo around that time just vaguely generic trash being put forth apps were people duo logy was just inducing huge amounts cringe eyes they could would bleed excessively minutes more that shit and wouldn have laptop write this their topics have diluted and not innonative these new sketches not have that punch that attraction that pre roast had they just make you giggle overestimation now and not make you think about even for second rape your fault and contents like that are really good they try edgy dank and fail most the memes that people think dank aib stuff the last kind during trend there facebook group that creates all these meme trends which presumably the most innovative and creative meme group when the meme trend dies and discarded aib thinks now should they went from group comedy collective brand business ,1
good start but think small lota gomutra trishul copy oak book should included this starter pack ,1
aib guys were good before 2015 after that they have been utter trash pretentious bad acting super cringe and what not especially rohan joshi can stand him though once while they good sketches like honest engineering tvf the other hand favourite they have been quite consistent and their quality has improved the latest season bachelors was amazing even their secondary channel the screen patti also very good tvf actors also seem humble compared the aib guys plus tvf guys can actually act though used enjoy bhuvan bam feel that seen everything has offer you amazon prime member there are tons stand shows which are very good like kal main udega biswa mast aadmi haq single and keeping real ,1
aib more focused different things now sketches not interest them anymore the reason they release generic sketches keep their youtube channel going which pays for staff and such ,1
even their instagram page thrash they really try hard edgy and dank but ends like posts see comedycemetery,-1
all comedians are trageting specific demographic aib content suitable for year olds for grown ups please watch the likes varun grover and kunal kamra witty political and issue based comedy your thing,1
 somewhat right but there are reasons don think the core members write sketches anymore they probably supervise scripts and have passed the baton new talent writers these new writers may lead sketches different direction comedy something which the old aib fans are not used someone mentioned already they have gone mainstream their first goal was recognised being edgy now that they are recognised they need expand their footprint that means pandering the common man with normal sense humour and now that they are organisation pretty sure they have legal team they consult before pushing the envelope like the roast they are responsible for the employment odd employees not just the them anymore also the conforming adviertisers part necessary evil they need the videos bring money that they can invest that into things they really love aib first draft one them mean there organisation india that appreciating new and upcoming writers like aib they are spending what estimate lakhs rupees from doing sellout videos have wait and see but one thing the group aib old fans have come terms with aib not just about the core members anymore they are giving the next gen writers chance rather than just continuing like they did which would have gotten boring too ,1
aib hired social media run their facebook page instagram etc they hired quite lot guys who were famous twitter and facebook most the twitter humour didn translate well into the sketches see tried googling the names writers who were involved the last two sketches one name popped twitter with decent following but the tweets were awful had friend once telling how tanmay had hired someone because meme with the word randi but then hired this guy and can ask him for some screenshots about the same had told how this guy had tried creating drama and even called friend call him ugly lol know trying get hip with this millenial and unfunny bunch employees has fucked aib over ,-1
never liked aib ,-1

 probably fair say that they overhyped particularly certain vocal communities who get more clout than they deserve due the diminutive size the hobby and the marketing point audiophilia used almost entirely the domain rich old men but schiit snarky shit concept extremely compatible with the growing demographic budding audiophiles looking step the average consumer dipping their toes probably wants somewhere between what unfairly dismissed some random chinese garbage and product from established western audio company with schiit all american parts design craftsmanship and for you can get nonsense end game piece with american quality unfortunately all falls apart upon closer scrutiny build quality dirt cheap volume knobs tend aluminium veneer hollow plastic frame and cases are usually comprised couple aluminium sheets and standard phillips screws soldering atrocious with hazardous flux not cleaned moreover considering certain common issues they had the past likely not part their operating cost the products have also been measured few occasions with results not meeting published specs objective measurements matter they the only source reliable information online and they also the specs which you advertise purchase these products ironically the oft dreaded chi companies sometimes use high quality parts from japan germany etc while additionally certifying their products regulatory standards schiit doesn even have good customer service despite being native english speaking company they claim american parts design service quality when the company often inferior many all these areas competitors even from china disruptive upstart indeed ,1
title ghalti mistake man baat ,0
 did jim carrey from liar liar hopefully goes for long time ,-1
 blunt despite their quality amp selection schiit dacs measure and regarding some measurements are almost insulting audio engineers don mean this personal attack against schiit its engineers much against the product itself however for some people they still subjectively sound good just like beats some people subjectively sound good despite measuring terribly thus positive recommendations sbaf and elsewhere abound perhaps schiit discovered facet audio that while not measuring well pleasing the human ear bold and dangerous claim for purveyor dacs still would not the first time that happened audio history see tubes but find myself skeptical this sense find personally unethical recommend schiit dacs new audiophile simply looking for clean source there are many alternatives for similar price that measure far better just would feel recommending beats fledgling audiophile actually but perhaps not the same magnitude hope that most directly addresses your point any further discussion leads drama and long convoluted debate what means audiophile regardless hope that one day schiit steps and starts designing quality dacs their industrial design certainly looks beautiful jpg and love have schiit stack again without having worry about dac quality but you have schiit stack don worry about replacing unless you have multibit product which case would recommend that you look elsewhere should your itch for upgrading strike again ,1
vomit shah has finally vomited the truth ,0
marketing wise perhaps when you first dive into the hobby you see their name pop more consistently mix legitimately good reviews some shilling the website laid out well and easy digest sane price points the low mid end allure good warranty sound wise not really comparable beats the amps magni jot specifically perform well their price points the dacs should probably avoided unless you heard and liked them are there better products maybe audio aune ifi massdrop etc etc have competitive options that price point ideally look your power design use and warranty requirements and from there ,1
apparently people had some trouble interpreting rule tonight everybody who behaving like fuccboi gets perma that includes offtopic and troll comments edit just nuke everything and restart this discussion without those users,-1
 late and sorry but locking this thread realize been going for full day but even after most the discussion has died down seen rule violations multiple ban evasions you been reported admins already sheer idiocy suggestions that should ban anyone whose reddit account younger than three months from participating this subreddit seriously headphones you usually much better than this for the next thread please remember the title this song cmprlqzktb8 ,-1
definitely not like beats everything audio highly subjective and after certain point everything depends more less your own personal taste and preference don have experience their multibit stuff but owned several their low midrange products and have say they are solid personally don think you can wrong with schiit but you want something that measures well and doesn use off the shelf audio chips have look chord products even the tiny mojo packs punch and has problems driving most headphones out there including your sennheisers regarding mojo replaced schiit bifrost and bakoon amp combo and has served well for the past year and half both desktop and portable unit now considering getting either questyle cma400i schiit lyr multibit because want the extra juice for lcd plan buying some point the future ,1
that difficult question answer some people don really like schiit because their customer service ceo the way talks about his product and the results independent 3rd party measurements makes him come off incredibly pompous that enough deter next that they measure insanely poorly for their price range this where the discussion gets fun some people swear that the errors introduced schiit gear make music sound better others say that there reason that chinese device that costs fraction what schiit charges topping d30 should measure better pretty much every category pretty much argument between objectivists measurements and mathematics and subjectivists essentially just listen how sounds and base your opinions that think schiit marketing what really props everything for them from the irreverent marketing pages the name designed appealing and endearing and does great job that but far audio with everything else subjective but rather spend money elsewhere for alternative lot people talk the audio products have the r2r and has some errors the audible spectrum according the ultimate headphone test sounds and have yet hear sound where the particular error itself can heard and distinguished from the music only the frequency test brought attention the error the dac portion getting new amp wouldn fix the issue that being said like try some more products down the line topping and audio nfb specifically that civil enough answer sources were sbaf sorry lost the threads and pretty much all the links posted here from audio science review ,1
transfer transfer transfer  that ,0
 mean why would she wanna accept award from non governmental organization she probably has better things like kick bad guys asses ,-1
the jotenheim doesn have and likely will never have multibit dac the schiit multibit board barely fits into the modil multibit and the dac module the jotenheim fraction that size the current and only dac module for the jot akm 4490 based like mine and think sounds better than any soundcard receiver dap mobile dac than have ever owned possible the audiogd the ifi black label stuff sounds better but really liked the iem power connector the jot haven really heard this just better alternative proposed for does everything desktop dac amp combo ,1

the settlement was reached per the laid down banking procedures “all the
necessary legal procedures have been followed the case the one time

there are lot factors considered banks before giving this quantum loan given the right way two loans 20cr each means the past performance had been good per books couldn have got sanction otherwise but here the fishy part loans availed 2009 and suddenly within years the profits are gone simply not possible this level there must some collusion with the bankers audited few banks where found some small level politicians availing loans and then making them npas boss told that this common practice with them they need cash either for personal use for use elections they avail loans convert cash through dummy billing and then declare bankruptcy the balance cash which untraceable used per their wishes obvious here that they had inflated the company books show profits and when they converted cash the company went out business this the only reasonable explanation otherwise the bank would have atleast 100 prime security stock and debtors and minimum collateral properties not possible all that they diminished all their prime security and left collateral only for 25cr middle class person like goes avail loan against property the maximum eligibility would current market value property can believe they had only 25cr worth property clear scam ,1

 think the feeling here that they are not being heard before jaya death there was atleast feeling that there someone strong enough take our issues the center but since her death the govt seen puppet the center and its functioning only because modi help ops himself accepted this recent interview speech there sense helplessness amongst the people and that why people had come out huge numbers for jallikattu because they were sure that the govt would not anything make case for against the center have not seen this kind mobilization for protests before jaya death maybe social media contributed well but this being taken advantage ever protesting groups like seeman vaiko etc can only hope that this interim phase and would end when the next elections happen and proper govt elected having said that well deserved especially with the way modi has put state elections ahead governance ,1

 have pretty limited experience the world but while feeling disgusted over the development our little girls rape and murder couple fucked individuals thought struck mind now what say here and henceforth opinion and viewpoint please help change viewpoint and help reach conclusion thought struck mind what seeing and reading about today largely reports media and spokespersons neither which have held value come close unbiased source similar rant episode was developed with much more fervour when the girl dangal accused man sitting behind her molestation and faced intense criticism and much more everyone pounced him but when the said accused was not found guilty everyone forgot about like never happened now not saying that this the case similar the one hand nor case study but how does help when people take the words others the truth without much research investigation into the matter other words how does help when everyone overreacts and one person says what happened fucked but what more important how fight back how counteract this problem that plaguing this country now the reason why felt this thought because couple months back there was this pretty diluted news wherein brother slit the throat man who was relationship with his sister what was more fucked was did front his sister and the victims family the aggressor was minority and the victim was not didn get much media attention felt wasn covered enough cuz never heard the end know argument isnt perfect that because isn meant ask you change this viewpoint mine ,1

 ways look either people collectively are stupid meaning just forget there need frame argument people aren stupid for which the following can said there reason inc ruled the country for long even after having been thrown out power just quarter century after first elections the republic its because they are the least evil the known devil while the rest are just pure incompetence with little redeeming features people hate things like corruption bribes and inefficiency but they are willing let slide provided they are compensated other critical ways things which run deep like socio cultural liberty etc indian political establishment inc alternatives even after decades still haven learnt how rule and adjust the power and what brings they have excelled the act gaining snatching power because that what the primary driver was since they were out power for long actually lead requires experience state not the country indian states are overall indian standards quite homogeneous and culture such not everyone can lead and adjust having power its not necessarily bad good thing itself what ,-1

 agree wanted say this for long time but you found the words best your title that said grew more woke social issues that existed pre bjp and that were perpetuated during congress rule feel that despite promising change the bjp have only made these issues worse things like treatment farmers and adivasis individual human rights against the state policemen abusing their power but until bjp came power could not understand why people would take arms against the state now but say not just bjp problem has been there boiling over for while the bjp have added lot more flame proving completely indifferent and making dalits and muslims section that were already oppressed and fearful under congress rule feel constantly under attack there are terrible consequences creating cycles violence most people not think these through and can only react when the reaction their reaction finally strikes perhaps they will realize and will too late ,1

one mla commits heinous crime raping minor and the system doesn seem doing what should that worrysome really bad but think could easily have been mla from another political party like congress aap etc think what worries more the crime rate these parts india and how some people seem lead the life goon there are many instances like this there something fundamentally wrong with the way some these bastards perceive life and the things that they this case was political person but the truth that this keeps happening these parts india frequently and that worrysome many rapes committed common men villages unnoticed and unreported the mentality that the real question true indian should ask himself how change mentality people these parts india all that wait for opportunities like this get other political parties from neutral point view for this post actually far fetched stop supporting political party just because asshole person did what did and adding that the police system like said this could easily another person from another party problem existing these parts india one person does not represent political party and every political party there will saints and there will criminals like this the right punishment has given and example needs set that nobody above the law not support any political party just rationalist and cynic ,1
 how can anyone vote for bjp good conscience now the same way they voted for after the 2002 pogrom pogrom where pregnant was disemboweled and her foetus thrown into fire did not prick the conscience the voting public then why should two measly rapes now you know horror stories type when you summon the devil asks something return voting them power was the faustian deal the people india made with the bjp ,1

 firmly believe political parties are reflection society all parties have good and bad people like society anger over such incident not only expected but important reminds that such incident not okay crime against women feature indian society not political issue but don expect political parties not hop issue which has captured peoples attention and hearts can hate any given party any given issue due the size such institutions due the law large numbers indian society will collapse before rises and such incidents are critical changing the way our society has developed ,-1

 have never ever seen single person good intentions support bjp yet there thing delusion naivety when comes supporters bjp there one who supports them because they don know what they really are like minded people support them with full consciousness they may into petty things like tax evasion religious caste fanaticism but given the opportunity they won back out from any crime just like the people they support ,1
 comes down what you think the lesser evil any given point time 2014 many people were convinced the lesser evil was modi and the bjp that said you are right this bjp victory 2019 will finish india off and probably end some kind civil war which probably what the hindutva folks actually want ,-1

first all there was never and there hard line that divides muslims india from muslims outside and there was any chance that post 1947 pakistan creation killed trying limit muslims india does not make sense fact what will make sense see muslim behaviour when they are majority and contrast with when they are minority why think that islam its current form problem humans long for model live life and one that assuages natural fears death religions try and that and communism imo faded despite its formidable showing the last century because had answers what happens beyond death but perfect religion needs explain human nature well enough quell scepticism from the most thoughtful sceptic the more enquiring person terms philosophy the harder sell religion with only rituals pray five times day for example observation islam oversimplifies everything makes very convenient not think and not question when zealot observes that people are not how the world should his and almost always first instinct change whether acts not woman not being modest cover her someone bowing idol smash and good analogy the gun control argument that rages the united states proponents unrestricted gun ownership point out that gun instrument and only the person who judges whether use not and that the instrument cannot blamed similarly metaltemujin wrote this let not talk about what the quran says doesn say talk about how muslims behave regardless are not talking religion only action and interaction but going the gun analogy guns make lot easier similarly islam opinion makes lot easier for person extremist skill thinking other areas does not immunise the person since are dealing with axioms that people don naturally question they don question because religious models the world are specifically address deep fears mortality and existential fear plus course most have education philosophy any discussion what your problem with muslims the quran and the hadiths need part ,1

see every religion old and archaic but some points which trouble are follows not generalising the community the religion terrorists belonging lashkar toiba and hizbul mujahideen get mass funerals attended thousands people terrorist who was gunned down the security forces the valley received gun salute from fellow militants midst mourners these mourners were ordinary villagers who had come mourn the death terrorist belonging group coordinating with qaeda support for yakub memon this something which rankled the core was still bearable for burhan wani get support because was phenomenon one extremity the country but the massive amount people who gathered for yakub funeral was scary because was much further into the mainland don think that terror convict who has been hanged the supreme court for orchestrating communal bomb blasts the part the company now allied with the haqqani network deserves such funeral support for zakir naik this one uncomfortable but troubling aspect zakir naik aggressive minion who harps belittling other religions proclaim his faith superiority over the rest has advocated death for apostates support for sexual slavery and support for osama apart from being fast talking charlatan who lies pulls out fictious names out nowhere while denying evolution among host other things actually quite dangerous and has been accused inspiring the dhaka terror attackers now would certainly understand this guy were fringe but enjoys widespread popularity much that parties such the iuml and the aimim came support him focus far away international events while ignoring nearer problems home was reading wiki article the iranian election protests 2009 against alleged vote rigging the authorities support ahmadenijad today while scrolling down the article saw the various cities where protests were held most were inside iran while some were cities where there were sizeable number iranian diasporas naturalised iranian citizens but among all those cities was hyderabad too indian hyderabad don yet understand this why did some people hyderabad feel attached the elections iran that they protested against the results what are the priorities why does event quarter way across the world hold sway why similarly just don understand why there were riots azad maidan due events myanmar myanmar india ofcourse not why were there riots you see buddhist groups rioting india because they persecuted malaysia you see the hindu groups rioting because the hindus are oppressed pakistan the same way you see the christians rioting the same way because they oppressed pakistan partition this was horrific event what important that the muslim majority provinces india had muslim league governments power most the eligible voters was based limited franchise voted for the muslim league why that most the muslim voters undivided india voted for the muslim league while most the hindu voters ditched the communal hindu mahasabha vote for the congress which was largely secular this isn focused india but nevertheless have you heard the undhr its global consensus based charter basic principles focused highlighting basic human rights which should enjoyed each and every human regardless their identities its ideals are lofty and universal now have you heard the cairo declaration human rights was charter made and signed almost all members the organisation islamic countries was made opposition the unhdr which was condemned the oic members being based judeo christian values firstly ironical them oppose the unhrd because they based judeo christian values isn moses prophet islam isn jesus prophet islam why are the oic countries opposed the norms which are allegedly derived from the values which these prophets valued and practiced secondly and importantly the cairo declaration seemingly restricts the rights non muslims and declares shariat being the source law making note there other parallel cdhr nations belonging other religions such hinduism and buddhism question the whole world finds the unhdr lofty and ideal then why the muslim majority states have problem with much they were forced create restrictive alternative how you justify religious rule our history replete with muslim kings being harsh towards non muslims curtailing their rights compared muslims while the past past don understand why some these potentially divisive figures are marketed being the paragons tolerance some members the community for example aurangzeb considered mujhadid islamic reformer who saved amd rejuvenated islam some you think that figure divisive this being looked upto good guy step towards good relations ofcourse not edit why did the pew poll 2003 show majority indonesia tolerant country supporting osama confidence osama poll 2005 showed osama support pakistan the poll was held just the aftermath instead anger and resentment there was approval osama the opinions these states pakistan and indonesia dropped turned against him only after started targeting the civilians the muslim majority countries why was high the first place just because americans indians spainards and the french were attacked aren these humans just like the rest edit why are muslims states such and the the least integrated community the considered the western world christian fundamentalism citadel and yet overall going polls christians are rather marginally better terms accepting socially progressive views why that the muslim community appears the bottom the list measuring social progression everywhere you have seen this across the atlantic and france ,1
its their way life their ideologies and beliefs they are hate mongering people man they dont just dislike hindus they hate everyone else this comes from first hand experience cuz live city where muslim numbers are high and they are always creating some sort discomfort bad some places you are not muslim you wouldnt dare enter the area honestly dont feel safe when around them ,-1
 judge people based history and think anyone who doesn either lying stupid also not against any muslim christian against stupid ideologies though especially when they are taught kids against madrassa and christian hindu prayers school national anthem should the only acceptable morning ritual don out the way stay away from muslim christian but won out way befriend them either also life had had few muslim friends and few christian friends one thing that was common childhood muslim friends was that they used tell their parents don want them play with hindus anymore and they would soon start ignoring this has happened more then ones just call coincidence the thing that happened with christian friends that they someone their family would constantly talk about religion and why should accept jesus which made dislike them and started ignoring them this has also happened with families that had know who were converts was clear that convert they will benefit somehow also plz mention single area where there was muslim majority and bjp won ,-1
awrite very liberal right winger for which get abused both sides sadly let weigh personally this might sound like the cliched have black friend thing americans say but true have quite few close muslim friends one dad closest friends muslim and practically grew their house they used visit singapore often and had nintendo and these are not even remotely close what even orthodox muslims are they drink don observe ramzan few even eat pork safe say that own family way more orthodox than these people maybe the only trope that might hold father friend has like kids broader level believe islam india was tempered exposure the dharmic faiths tippu aurangazeb being exception the british policy divide and rule soured matters and poisoned the atmosphere creating massive distrust what though was the worst thing happen islam india was the spread wahabbi poison think about growing the even have you seen this many hijabs bearded men the thing muslims india have always had lunatic fringe but the mainstream was definitely way more integrated the spread the cancer wahabbism though has only increased the number both the lunatic fringe well pushing even the more moderate muslims into increasingly orthodox position look india and you will see anywhere there muslim hindu violence you will see wahabbi times deobandi influence kerala the problems will continue for long wahabbi influence and money flood the region turn off the tap and believe lot the problems will ease,1
the greatest issue with muslims their behavior suppressing minority religious culture harassment and imposing conversations for instance old city muslim hyderabad within 500 meters from mosque there bhagya lakshmi temple hindus are not allowed ring bell give arrthi loud speakers muslims community responsible for this religious suppression there zero historical evidence that once muslims become majority hindus will allowed practice their religion like muslims are doing hindu country kashmir borders west bengal assam muslim majority districts kerala have convinced that muslims will kill hindus once your religion becomes majority politically muslims have consistently sought legally alienate themselves from indian constitution and have been against integration insistence sharia fighting abolishing triple talaq practically muslim have ended the opposite side india interests most geopolitical issues rohingya friendly relations with israel etc socially you have accept that your religion socio political ideology masquerading faith individual such your self might not responsible but members your community are responsible for rapes hindu women assam west bengal love jihad real thing even people canada france have acknowledged that these are happening for fuck sakes muslims come temple kund and harass hindu women last but not least because muslims lost our country you believe ghazwa hind why that hindus have accept hindu women married muslim men but muslims kill hindu men who love muslim girls this not invasion zakir naik owaisi and the reception they are getting broke all the hope that muslims will put country above religion considering all this there zero trust that muslims can trusted moreover personal belief that muslims don have clue what makes civil society ,1
 have problems with muslims personally don like their religion and because their correligionists literally slaughtered half family during the partition thankfully alive because great grandparents came here through the violence father always talked about hindu muslim riots the most common theme was that there was hindu procession passing through was the muslims who started with the stone pelting and attacking the hindus with swords and things once the mob had reached the door our house well thankfully they realized that grandfather was probably armed and his brothers were ready fight them off die the attempt that scared the bastards shitless what was sickening was not the fact that these people were some randos off the street but people known for ages east bengal the very families whose lives were saved ancestors because they were doctors the same people came kill them when told miracle god that survived ,1

 take rather separated from the usual analysis see proffered here but believe merits consideration believe what ’ seeing almost instinctive backlash the rapidly accelerating advancement western civilization itself when people think accelerating advancement they’ usually focused the ever increasing advances see science and technology but our technology also driving major changes almost every facet our society similarly expanding rates our economy jobs social convictions entertainment religious beliefs culture interpersonal relationships and communications lifestyles almost every facet our lives being subjected radical changes speed never before witnessed and the changes are only occurring faster with time author scientist inventor ray kurzweil contended that 2000 were overall advancing much did the entire 20th century every years 2014 had advanced another 20th century’ worth knowledge estimates 2021 ’ add another 20th century worth knowledge mid century predicts ’ adding that incredible amount knowledge several times year and and that pace advancement driving changes throughout our lives with two major exceptions our biology and our government famed biologist edward osborne wilson once wrote the real problem humanity the following have paleolithic emotions medieval institutions and god like technology and ’ right while our science and technology driving headspinning rates change that force deal with multiple major upheavals our lifetime are genetically indistinguishable from humans that didn’ experience notable change their lives dozens generations and our governmental institutions were largely based formed centuries ago when the pace advancement generally allowed for only incremental changes facet two regular person’ experience his her lifetime our history predisposes towards expecting level consistency our modern world longer provides and our governments are built somewhat intentionally towards slow and incremental changes which leaves them ill equipped effectively manage the absolutely monumental shifts our very societal structure that are going needed going forward with that mind seems natural that the more conservative you are person the more strain average you’ likely feeling world where traditions fade quickly and change everywhere backlash forms and seeks out “other” blame and unfortunately those tend drawn from old fears and bigotries past they wish never ended but will never return hear mexicans are stealing our culture and the chinese are stealing our jobs even though the facts are the internet has done far more change the culture than some latinos moving into the neighborhood ever did and automation has plainly been replacing most our manufacturing labor and will coming for many more sectors the coming years not trade fear don’ see this stress that’ going relieve itself soon fact ’ going get much worse time goes forward and more people are going become stressed the pace while the right getting most the attention now the fringe left being driven the same strains they’ just being drawn towards different bigotries the rich the politicians the “establishment” that the left typically demonize the left isn’ succumbing quite fast but pressures increase will the likelihood extremism from all portions the population the hope that society can understand the reality faces and help each other identify and cope with these strains instead tearing itself apart and that really need functioning and forward thinking government can’ say ’ super optimistic the moment ,1
 don think that surprising that right leaning politicians win elections around half the time the yes obama was president from 2009 2017 but before that george bush was president for years and before clinton republicans won out presidential elections between 1968 and 1988 these things tend back and forth like pendulum one side wins then takes things too far people put the other side charge for while the same most democratic countries different question but maybe the one you are really trying ask why immigration and nationalism have become hot button issues the last few years the 1990s and 2000s the right was more free market pro trade pro immigration because pro business but the last decade has because more nationalistic populist anti trade and anti immigration there are several explanations but every country going have different one for example europe has largely been driven the refugee crisis and the poor way that has been handled the various governments the began with the financial crisis and increase immigration under bush but has also been driven liberal overreach number social issues under obama top this you got social media replacing television the main way people get news that local incidents are often blown into national incidents would also note that both left and right the extremes are getting more attention you have sanders the facto leader democrats the corbyn the leader labour the melenchon doing quite well france etc ,1
you have define right wing politics because that term general that use just dumb there have been slight surges things like anti immigration but there hasn been surge overall right wing support those numbers would reckon the same what changed the divide between parties and surge not being listened there have always been left leaning voters who vote right wing because the left wing they want isn focused labor yet isn the right supposed focus home grown local labor say there been surge voting for certain candidates and parties but not the actual belief what think right wing there have always been democrats the who been anti immigration and for something far more tempered than what have but democrats have doubled down and alienated some people there have always been republicans favor gay marriage and certain social issues but wasn until they didn adapt and the left took their votes that mattered and always the economy stupid democrats the are about adapting the new world but they been horrible equality republicans are least giving lip service people asking for change and democrats are hanging the glory few figures from obama two terms ,1
the simplest explanation that its because majority people who vote want right wing candidates and what they represent and not want left wing candidates and what they represent its less about messaging than the people perhaps remember the 2016 election was supposed jeb hillary with jeb being the chosen candidate the republican donors with without the republican base and hillary being the chosen dnc candidate with without the dem base both parties figured they could get their candidate pushed through without sunstantial blocs their mainstream voters tea partiers evangelicals the right and white working class the left the donor class spent 100 million and bought jeb electors and hillary spent way more and lost bernie nearly aced her out and trump tromped jeb very early the lesson pay attention what people want and shape your message accordingly its how trump won and sanders almost won and really would have not for the superdelegates ,-1
because left wing policies have failed massive level all they want more more gov control more regulations and higher taxes all this does drive the most productive people away because they get punished the hardest leaving nothing but the recipients those social welfare programs good luck taxing the rich when there one left tax when listen the speeches democrats just repulsed endless talk leveling the playing field racism and pushing lies like the gender wage gap don need the gov level the playing field need them get out way ,1
 working theory that one single thing responsible but the recipe the world perfect for the rise fascism globalization has driven mass global immigration which turn has resulted anti immigrant backlash globally this combined with growing wealth inequality gap and with the left most places embracing corporate interests rather than punishing rampant corporate malfeasance has all fed into rising discontent among those who are feeling these effects most trades and low skill workers are seeing more and more immigrants around them their paychecks are covering less and less and those with any power wealth are continuing accrue more while the the progressive parties the world typically known for representing the working class the exception here but the result the same because they have embraced big business the expense the working class thus people are unhappy with the current global model they feel forgotten the left this leaves huge vacuum for populist support which can capitalize peoples anger and fear powerful emotions that are the hallmarks authoritarianism ,1
things are good around the world that people have become politically complacent only the people that feel like the status quo bad were motivated not just participate but even pay attention ,1
 blame the media for trump win much the mainstream media stopped leaning and literally took sides this election think trump won the primary because the large pool candidates combined with lot the reasons listed this thread backlash identity politics racial tension outsider empty promises etc however really think the backlash against the media what put him over the top hillary who just was unlikable candidate went from people thinking trump tool don really like hillary trump isn bad they say don really like hillary ,1

 government overreach all time high unprecedented amount government services are experiencing critical failure with the internet becoming increasingly difficult for government control the narrative other emerging technologies are making government services irrelevant liberal social controls are going too far for the common man the economy booming especially employment metrics people are more informed and aware what the government actually does than they ever have been and the reality quite ugly meanwhile the liberal political platform seems want double down these programs and repeatedly gets caught things like disarming the citizenry lowering the voting age nonsexual bathrooms and forced servitude for small businesses but the most damaging factor all that the economy booming every week the common man seeing things that the liberal platform promised would never happen under conservative leadership from the pay increases and bonuses that flowed out post tax breaks north korea that moving towards peace perfect storm ,1

there couple reasons see for this though have been struggling formulate them into something coherent generally speaking long periods time dominated one side often results resurgence the other and that has been part but genuinely believe that specifically the right there growing population secular guess libertarians for lack better word the traditional right which was the dominant sector republicans shrinking the day and the next generation republicans aren going anything like the last gone are the days when gay marriage and religion were one the primary issues the right while issues like guns and migration will still primary issues the party expect see republicans whole become drastically more secular and oriented around nationalism and limited government rather than religion europe thats already happened quite while ago fact many places europe their parties are more far left and moderate left rather then the more traditional left wing right wing parties true right wing doesn exactly exist anymore europe atleast not large scale though europe there has been resurgence and based biased opinion people were tired political correctness persay they were tired the regulations the migration and often limited speech afd got relatively low numbers germany but they are growing quickly and very well could become primary party marie pen very nearly won and trump did the left the and the overall popularity right wing politics once again growing marie pen afd and donald trump are right wing but its not the fact that their right wing that causing resurgence think better call these parties nationalist people want their country put first again they want their sovereignty held above anything else not migrants not the their country donald trump campaign ran nationalism and putting the usa first things like migration nationalism and potentially free speech are going key issues for right wing parties and this the primary reason that right wing parties are beginning come back people were largely turned off the religious zeal the 90s gop while now still predominantly conservative this conservatism very much orientated around economics and migration rather than religion which has the potential draw people who were otherwise the fence and lot more appealing the average person ,1

 agree just one point their politico cultural vision wasn even hidden earlier bjp has always been clear about where stands wrt its interpretation indian history culture and the related notion who indian back 2014 one could find the following under the about party section their website the bharatiya janata party today the most prominent member the family organisations known the sangh parivar and nurtured the rashtria swyamsevak sangh rss the bjp wedded india’ unity and integrity its intrinsic identity and the social strength individual character and cultural uniqueness that have been the hallmark this great country and its people for millennia history the philosophy nations and the sangh parivar has very clear conception indian history here was great civilization whose influence and imprint spread from weathered the storms invaders from the greeks the huns from the shakas the islamic armies turks and afghans fought and resisted external oppression and its essential civilization and culture survived great challenges and attempts effacement the glory vijayanagara and the heroism maharana pratap shivaji and guru govind singh are testimony the indian spirit more recent times this torch nationalism and indian identity was carried forward swami dayanand and swami vivekanada and the present century the good work has been carried sri aurobindo lokmanya tilak mahatma gandhi and others… rss believes the principle justice for all and appeasement none has doubt about hindu identity and culture being the mainstay the indian nation and indian society this identity and this culture informs all indians irrespective religious denominational faith the rss all indians irrespective religious background notwithstanding their mode and place worship are equal note the rhetoric here appeasement and the identities being framed native outsider invader here don think even those who bought the development rhetoric were totally unaware these stances the party suspect instead that there soft hindutva the country which views such issues comprising cultural stance not political one while they may not condone violence they may support soft cultural issues course the political realm there such thing culture devoid politics and vice versa once cultural discourse such this has been established isn surprising see how would lead political polarization resentment against the called outsider invader and even violence the quoted section something cited paper wrote for course back 2014 not sure they still have the same description ,1

 myth that the bjp anyone else want impose hindi anybody what bjp rss and others with similar thought process want indian language lingua franca for indians and english not indian language happens that hindi the one indian language that spoken and understood the most number people the country the practical choice want indian language the lingua franca tamil assamese happened the indian language that was spoken and understood the most number people the country rest assured that bjp rss etc would batting for tamil assamese the lingua franca and please understand the meaning lingua franca the common language you use converse with other people whose native language something different from your own lingua franca does not mean national language official language anything the sort and all human beings for practical purposes need have some common language communicate with other people whose native language different even merely sign language may also interest people know that the called imposition hindi enshrined the constitution india article 343 html further the framers our constitution were very clear two points sanskritized hindi nor urdu ised hindi was the lingua franca english could the lingua franca for transition period years from when the constitution came into effect ,1
 you look all these govt organisations that promote hindi they were set congress afaik was always the congress that wanted hindi however now they have slyly disassociated themselves from and pushed onto bjp and the bjp being dumb actually supports considering that they party that follow ideology that seeks preserve indian cultures and languages why they continue might help them the hindi belt but this image will quite damaging beyond the vidarbhas opposition parties are spreading foolish rumours like how bjp wants divide maharashtra into vidarbha and maharashtra and add mumbai gujarat people buy into this because bjp image hindi chauvinist party when you say was always the congress that wanted hindi you believe sanghis and other pro hindus were not favor hindi also the congress those days was nationalistic organization brimming with people who held the interests india close their heart read tandon congressman who was elected president the party and who possessed idea nation ‘hindus’ and made reference hindu traditions and religion descriptions the nation somewhere down the line congress abandoned people like tandon heck just few hours ago this very sub narendra supporter spun apologia how having indulge first class secular giri because now how can one not expect congress that has much longer record having ruled india having down the same path that narendra had four bjp anything but dumb when about kamalabai never attribute stupidity what can explained malice the ideological fountainhead the bjp has made clear they want carve maharashtra into not two three but four small states destruction the marathi identity will open tremendous avenues for expolitation indo scythians ,-1

 thought was poetic manifestation the rage boiling inside kratos less literal change the weather and more like seeing the world through kratos perspective and that what going inside him ,1
hot damn,1
just thought had that the case then that would mean thor isn asgard would mean that the beating was brutal spilled over into other realms kinda curious since impression was thor wasnt midgard during the story ,-1

thank you this very informative ,1
 this like the longest post reddit ,0
there lot don know yet first thought was that atreus doing yeah but think that highly unlikely already demonstrated his version the spartan rage seconds before fell ill feel like giving him more powers especially the power affect the weather this degree overkill think got with thor odin raging kratos for decimating their family tree the first time the weather changed was when killed magni the second time modi just got his ass beat could just coincidence ,-1
ohhhh shit ,-1
 feel modi will good job when development india but hindustan has billion people hard achieve certain goals ,1
thor seems truly terrifying gow the sequel expansion needs hurry ,-1
holy cow this comprehensive thanks much bookmarking this post ,1
wow makes sense,1
there was two occurences odd weather one being when atreus sick and the other when gets rude sindri seems the weather tied his emotions ,-1
also happens shortly after the world serpent summoned while you the elevator maybe the two are related somehow ,0
 think also symbolism zeus influence kratos past and even his present during that boat ride athena also showed ,-1
 soon saw that happening got this really vivid nostalgic experience high school sitting english class and buddy shouting out pathetic fallacy after nobody would answer the teacher question about the weather changing due the scenario the story honestly was extremely ham fisted drama but god war supposed ham fisted guess pathetic fallacy get ,-1

added note survivor marquesas and survivor thailand used the different voice file ancient voices maybe beacuase the lawsuit that earthbeat license filed russ landau and the the show while the lawsuit continues survivor africa did local recoding for version instead then there the recorded version used marquesas and thailand the vocal tone completely different while lyrics remain similar the original voicetrack then reused survivor amazon and this might because they might settled down the arguements,1

 also disregarded literally everything was taught since birth about how gods are wrong for doing whatever they wanted the expense the mortals “but ’ god ” you’ shitty character who flipped quickly that ’ unbelievable tilted far fast and get that ’ for the sake story telling but come went from time disregarding everything ’ ever been taught and basically saying his mother can eat shit because she wasn’ god was super mommas boy and that type stuff just easily broke the immersion ,1
spoilers ,0
 beaten not threat ,0
 love atreus lot people don seem like him and think annoying brat which don see all except that the game where acting out but people said that even before they got that part overall think really cute sweet intelligent and curious kid who loves kratos ,1
 too bad turns out loki ,-1
 also love the dialogue after you beat the queen nice heart kratos acknowledge his development ,1
another redditor brought different thread but loved how the last baldur fight when kratos and baldur were top big platform cant remember which platform could have even been the giant kratos and baldur both get launched off the platform then atreus seeing his father going off cliff jumps off with him with literally hesitation then atreus shoots baldur while both them are moving mid air thought was epic and shows how much they have bonded ,1
can expect spartan raging boi next gow ,0
 honestly love the way they both progress throughout the game very well done,1
did you mean loki kratosson ,-1
 also appreciate his reactions like his maturity how apologized after realizing that his dad grieving too and instantly lifted when kratos said only felt like moments passed him how excitedly asked could turn into animal even his sad contemplation kratos final reveal after the last boss lot people give him flack and sometimes really bothers when see lot people say they want hit him mainly because corporal punishment was childhood but really adore the boy and all that brought the game his story development relationships and growth are amazing ,1
yeah when first saw the original gow trailer back kinda groaned great some snot nose kid ruin the game but boy was totally totally wrong usually kids are just not done right any medium and ruin things they are but atreus 100 improved gow being the game ,1
thanks for sharing this probably one the best posts seen this subreddit,1
 don’ know why read your post kratos’ voice ,0
there are million factors play for the changing demographics soon white people will longer majority the combined with the election obama and blm white reactionary movement has emerged beginning with birthers and ending with very fine people both sides globalization the decline manufacturing the has decimated parts the country combined with our atrocious access healthcare this started the opoid crisis the people effected these changes rural america are mostly white they overlap with the reactionary movement the rise right wing media the overton window has shifted dramatically the right with fox news talk radio and now youtube commentators the democrat economic messaging has mostly stayed the same for the past years whereas the gop has gone off the deep end social issues lgbtq issues are now mainstream people are talking about prison reform and ending the war drugs these are good things but white people from rural areas think that these social issues aren relevant them and rightly feel left behind some solutions democrats don need choose between race issues and white people ending the war drugs will help prison reform and mitigate the opoid crisis pushing for debt free college and funding for trade schools will solve number issues changing public school funding the state level longer based property taxes would help too ,1
 really enjoyed his development throughout the series wouldn mind controlling atreus for solo mission two future games like last edit words,1
 boy the year fixed that for you,1
spoilers also norse myth loki kills baldur thought that was cool and with the mistletoe arrow cool little spin the story ,1
mooooog taaaaay oooooom,0
because echo chambers opinion bigots every kind are being reaffirmed their beliefs every day and this has lead more traditionally conservative people feel more comfortable being racist sexist stupid public,1
 the final fight love the scene where thrown the air then shoots baldur mid air like badass,1
his growth incredibly well done was worried that wouldn’ like atreus because the only review had read prior the games launch only read due weird accusation against described him somewhat annoying was not annoying all and really grew care for his character ,1
the part where kratos explains the boy why named him atreus made cry grew love him quite bit and hearing kratos tell him the type person god wanted him and having basically all that happen just hit right the feels ,1
definitely great character certainly proved wrong was absolutely certain was going hate him will say this though his progression fantastic except for one bit where just suddenly reverts back being good matter seconds kinda felt really really rushed ,1
 also lot fights become trivial once you get into the habit tapping square ,0
 god damn did enjoy the cutscene kratos and atreus have when they were beating that ass,1
 like that arteus weapon the bow sure allows for puzzles more space cause the range and easy control him battle since you can just press square and hits the person you looking but even more than that think clever symbolism him and his fathers anger kratos before this game uses the blades chaos which just mess anything within city block himself just like his anger and rage was like this game axe that can pinpoint any one thing but still also bit cleavy and once his boy falls ill hesitant but uses that familiar rage his help but artues his weapon the bow requires power but also concentration rage but tempered and controlled and the end the game proves not only have that mindset but the ability with ,-1
that final shot also mirrors one from the beginning where boi misses and hits kratos ,0
this thread makes happy ,1
mass immigration and corrupt governments that simple every other issue causing right wing surge stems from those things,-1

there way this one sentence encompasses all that has say and all that actually meant you think logically about mobile phone important factor young love many these pairs will end having pre martial intercourse then for some reason lifelong commitment not made many them will cry rape that gross and overt oversimplification that using mobiles leads rapes but these people are far from literature graduates from university delhi and therefore certain gap between what said and what meant expected you become offended every headline you the one with problem ,1

freya has one son with odin which baldur thor was offspring odin’ relations with giantess ,0
this low not new for him,-1
 fairly certain that laufey placed that palm print before jotunheim was sealed and before she ever met kratos its also stretch assume that she planned the aesir downfall based her knowing the future interesting question don know she loved kratos was using him for his seed some combination them both even planned would have been her and the surviving giants collectively she obviously did not create the shrine within jotunheim her own don know the time line freya spell baldur but considering that she was physical contact the time imagine this had before her falling out with odin brok says during one his dialogs that try dead but details regarding his death show anywhere might early assume that hes actually gone you can also add odin corrupts sigrun and company the before the game section ,1
 before this mimir was romantically involved with sigrun the queen the valkyries unclear this why odin punished him freya used the queen the valkyries before sigrun but odin took her wings odin furious and has thor kill all jotun still midgard except jormangundr the world serpent kinda hard say since the jormungandr present the game came from the future wasn still born guess confusing ,-1

 our intrepid duo home for some well deserved rest during which atreus has dream set years the future read foresight where thor shows their door ready rumble when did this happen have yet see this cutscene but beat the game gmgow ,-1

because corruption million times better than communalism only thing cared about during congress that would have pay some money for office works but never think twice before passing any comments about congress felt free but yeah there was little price for nowdays don even talk about anything political public space without fearing random bhakt spawning everything just too much controlled nowdays india nowdays like passive and demo version north korea hope you guys won buy the full version this shit 2019,1
modi shah power hungry duo nothing else like our 20s want money and success they wanted power they chased and got pair that with their ideological ambitions which were apparent the reuters breaking and you get the picture their development agenda rahul the other hand seems more human and less artificial has good heart and comes off better human when compared modi someone said another answer that they compared modi worst rahul best modi best monologue speeches oration and mann baat ffs quoting sonia gandhi from her only karnataka rally speeches don feed the hungry there slayed also won particularly vote for rahul but vote wild more against modi shah and bjp and for that need opposition which making considering mamta for that leadership find her impulsive and boy you are watching bengal then you know she can potentially worst than modi pawar while kingmaker too old hold that chair and himself knows that which true for gowda too akhilesh while good needs get rid his chacha mamas like shivpal shiv sena not even center right but right not even considering them anyone else from south like ncn kcr anyone else basically would after period such divide would not accepted the north the big names didn miss anyone you have nitish arvind rahul nitish turned otherwise had potential arvind much would love see him revolutionise india education and healthcare system still needs one experience politics that opposition doesn get his nerves which they will and two needs expand his footprint outside delhi become force the national scenario with that remains rahul with anyone who follows politics followed him closely knows that isn pappu anymore that only what modi shah wants believe but isn betting money him and karnataka crucial ,1

cuz dont lie,0
 had commented this another similar thread few days ago here are reasons vote for rahul gandhi decent human being leader having some sense humility and inherent kindness great quality imho not the pappu the bjp wants believe like everyone else also fell for the bjp propaganda but the truth when watched some his interactions with people town hall style especially the bangalore ones genuinely felt that his goals are larger interest our people and clear about that plz watch his press conference bangalore today and you know pappu not takes press conferences and gives interviews ours democracy where leaders should asked questions without fear and they must face the independent press government not one man show the congress has relatively much better talent pool than the bjp like his thinking about respecting our differences caste creed religion etc basically believer unity diversity don claim that the perfect leader for our country but will surely take chances dynast and his party has image being corrupt but still better than the morally bankrupt crass communal and divisive leader the bjp and his party edit let also confess that had voted for the bjp the 2014 elections first time voter that time 2017 gujarat assembly elections voted for the congress and 2019 general elections will the same ,1
 dont want communal riots want hindus sikhs muslims christians dalits and other various communities all live together peacefully believe our liberal constitution and judiciary dont want right winged government change destroy ,1
sad that country with smorgasbord parties only have two unqualified options,-1
ugh fairly new politics have been modi supporter anymore though cast first vote 2019 used laugh rahul but never hated him and this isn the case now prefer rahul over modi simply because hate modi rahul maybe son nepotism but you look the other side actually educated humble accepts his mistakes and team man and all these qualities are absent modi who basically one man government and narcissist pathetic liar and seems quite arrogant policies like demonitization are another reason and keeping mind most his other policies are well advertised and renamed policies upa often fail see the talent one might see congress fail spot leaders like tharoor mms bjp and doubt their approach stuff like not appointing lokpal even after having absolute majority and frca and finance bill makes you question they actually want work for the country haven even talked about communalism yet have seen people change their stance and hate certain minorities more after 2014 than before hating minorities muslims common and such people are often modi supporters and such statements from the bjp members also sufficiate point one might say that have seen more worse under congress 1984 and all but probably because congress has been power more the anti muslim stand bjp isn the same with congress not their idealogy yes they minority appeasement times but they are still more secular than bjp imagine muslim leader from bjp rss nearby future seems quite unlikely while saw mms from congress even after what happened sikh riots have typed lot and not all just get the gist ,-1
 don agree with the hindutva ideology and implications for religious and linguistic minorities feel the bjp governments are more prone promoting pseudo\ science \ ayush\ and anti\ intellectualism the country with disastrous consequences the long run for example they went ahead with demo based even when the consensus among economists was that bad idea find the way modi talks really crass and can sometimes really malicious \ like the 100cr remark and inappropriate comments about sonia ancestry\ does not seem too bright but have rarely heard him trade personal insults the level that our current has,1
tina \ there alternative\ ,0
 fight between corruption and tyranny always choose corruption,0
 don vote for fascists ,0
because bjp hates caste and way life the congress government policies education over the decades have helped lift community and family out poverty has helped remove some the stigma associated with people modi myopic only thinks about winning elections lacks all the qualities statesman rahul gandhi inept but don think corrupt wants prime minister his party pushing him between the two alternatives will obviously pick the one who won kill ,1
because the number one priority any government towards its citizens their security none the economic indicators gdp growth fdi growth ease doing business matters citizen long the government cannot commit their security and the truth minority today increasingly fear for and family safety the current bjp rule \ the cow lynching happened nearby town mine jharkhand know the threat real\ muslim and highly educated and integrated one \ supported bjp 2014\ feel that modi government has only alienated minorities and today none the muslim community even the educated ones support bjp \ know plenty well educated doctors circle\ and see the society highly polarized along the lines religion also loathe bjp because the party authoritative has zero sense accountability and pretty much one man show they have been riding high their modi wave they win elections based modi and then give power incompetent and communal leaders like biplab and yogi the whole cabinet with the exception sushma swaraj and rajnath singh almost incompetent although the entire decision making just \ man gujju show and this going even worse the next election while they out all\ out assault with modi\ modi chant really want their ego broken this election besides recent election campaigns has really shown modi insecure leader who has been constantly personally attacking and rather than talking about his government achievements the constant whataboutery the nehru and years congress rule seems never ending and frankly annoying raga the other hand has adopted much sensible approach and does not look like the ill\ informed politician that saw the 2014 elections has maintained level decency the recent karnataka election campaign while the bjp has constantly gone for below the belt attacks with congress risking vote for another corrupt government which can live with with bjp risk communal government that cannot guarantee mine family safety which cannot live with ,-1
 voting doesn work sdupui8o7rw ,0
 will vote for congress for two reasons they better job bringing together people from diverse opinions and ideas and make things work together they respect institutions and rule law fair degree compared other regimes like the present one just look the fate rti and lokpal under current govt which swears open and transparent rahul genuinely feels like someone who listens others compared dear leader inexperienced but pretty sure does have the right people around him run the govt for manmohan pitroda rangarajan etc ,1

people india let ask you the same question that the bjp has been asking not rahul then whom maun modi ,0
 have vote congress because the alternative this case bjp hindutva party well understood now however their continued fake news generating factory and utter disregard for institutions and checks what worries the recent budget passing process was total mockery parliamentary proceedings the speaker constantly adjourning house after minutes avoid confidence motion and now the vice president declining accept motion for impeachment understand that speaker and chairman are party members and they always had biases for their parties however the amount contempt they shown other parties never heard judiciary another victim the process complete subjugation all institutions that could keep check the govt obvious that the govt has some dirt cji and using gain benefit the poor guy has had much bad publicity trying support the bjp and yet still continues could and the basic idea that they are trying build authoritarian empire not good for democracy might have had our failures development process but what keeps hopeful that the country will keep growing incorporating every voice see that future danger ,-1
because during congress mostly heard about monetary gains corruption and heinous crimes were very uncommon rare not mention that almost daily get shaheeds maybe more congress mostly cares about money even they caused some mass voilence very infrequent the end motive was only money still don know what this motherfucking chutiya wants spreading all this blood shed and hatered know that going hell for saying this but still maa chudhaye ramrajya tldr congress does roam around raping little girls and and killing our men border and still have the courage say bhaiyo aur behno,1
 vote for the most popular party other than bjp that ncp over here ,1
just one reason not modi used laugh his goof ups earlier that interview with arnab really made think how big idiot was but then saw how modi ran the country one man rule one was allowed show dissent even hadn redeemed himself perhaps with the help better social media team still prefer him because being incompetent much better than being competent the wrong things wish kejriwal was more popular could support him but voting for him general election would waste therefore rahul ,1
 won vote for bjp modi because dont want india turn into pakistan bjp rss opposes secularism bjp rss believe religion the basis nationality bjp rss believe blasphemy genuine reason kill people vilification minorities rampant bjp rss blame nehru for their problem bjp rss peddle religious nonsense science almost anyone including congress led rahul gandhi much better than the orange baboons power aap fielding good candidates constituency then might vote for them else congress ,1

because consider the best option after witnessing demonetization the slow decay the secular fabric our nation and failure implement most development economic policies properly although demonetization should technically included this but rightfully its own separate category top that the current administration lacks the integrity own its responsibilities just pushes the blame for everything and anything negative everyone else including the citizens while risking not take corrective measures time would have own screwing things see the current administration being worse than the previous one due the above mentioned points will voting inc even they are not gonna win see rahul gandhi now being competent enough for switch vote from nota inc,1

corruption begnine problem compared communalism mostly because everyone agrees that corruption problem and needs tackled communalism the other hand risks alienating and disenfranchising our minorities dividing along our religious and casteist faultlines worse yet lot people not see this problem ironically modi and bjp may the greatest national security threat have faced independent nation because what happens when percent the population doesn feel that they belong here and therefore not have stake ,1

 find both parties similar with intent work for country corruption even policies bjp may slightly right centre whereas congress slightly left but major difference policies you can see bjp carrying all major congress policy decisions difference between two them are ideological whereas bjp more conservative hindu nationalists that’ what they pretend congress more liberal secular that’ what they pretend taking into consideration are going into same direction with almost similar speed with either the parties but how reach there important domination majority basis religion not good for country all developed nation try bring policies which tries curb racism narendra modi led bjp has created wide divide between religions castes and hate crime has increased too much recent times all the power one man’ hand and nobody can criticise him not even his party members modi haven’ faced single unbiased interview his term and the fake news propaganda they spread utter nonsense clearly lines fascism rahul gandhi led congress would least put break this rahul also faced open interviews various forum even the risk his image getting worse and there are good people their team would choose who would rather choose who would protect communal harmony than who would impose tyranny majority hindu but not favour this majoritarian realm hurts nation ,-1

liberalism means two very different things the one hand there liberalism the sense democracy and equal political rights the other hand there liberalism the sense the hegemonic political consensus the post 1970s dispensation which culturally relatively the left but economically relatively the right the weakness liberalism specifically that very last bit economically relatively the right this what undermining the rest the system capitalism causes economic precarity and economic precarity causes people become more authoritarian and xenophobic thereby undermining the other two pillars the system there need throw the baby out with the bathwater democracy isn the problem since dictatorships are proving just vulnerable democracies popular anger over economic circumstances the arab spring attests social liberalism isn the problem since socially conservative societies are proving just vulnerable socially liberal ones popular anger over economic circumstances the arab spring also attests view and think the view most leftists the only way salvage the desirable bits liberalism jettison the dead weight classical liberal economic policy you also find leftists who argue that the democracy political rights part liberalism also needs jettisoned but thankfully one really takes them seriously ,1

the bjp has amazing campaign machine they mobilize resources like nothing else and are able use resources and tech very smartly guide them towards victory for whatever reason the congress not even close achieving that but this just game numbers ultimately vote shares you just have look their vote shares see that while the two parties are evenly matched vote share the bjp has the number seats bigger mismatch than the election popular vote for reference clearly the bjp target constituencies with laser precision and the needful win anti incumbency obviously rife siddu govt has hardly covered itself glory the last years few votes here and there enough swing the election one way another 2013 elections congress had around the same vote share but the bjp had yeddy party had around the votes and was dividing the bjp votebank into two since then they kissed and made and the bjp has recovered its base little more due anti incumbency 2008 elections remember that this isn the first bjp govt karnataka they won 121 seats 2008 time when inc stock was pretty high nationally and they still had lower vote share than the inc 2014 general elections compared the 2014 wave bjp has ceded more vote share than the congress with regional parties grabbing that bit that about really this election doesn really seem like plebiscite national politics modi wave much reinforcement existing votebanks and emerging more powerful player people who are claiming that this the death democracy grow fan the bjp but imagine thinking that fucking siddaramaiah the defender democracy ,1
there are others given that the bjp seems set fall short the half way mark guarantee that these dudes will support the bjp amongst the constituencies yet poll one bjp safe seat any chance congress patch form the government ,1

from whatever have read can state the following please correct have erred understanding the law the governor has the job inviting any party alliance parties form the government with only one guiding principle must look for any capable parties who can have the majority the house ensure that the people dont have suffer another election top this the bommai verdict stated that must take decisions ensure that horse trading does not take place broadly has three basic guidelines decide which parties invite must sufficiently satisfied that the majority numbers the house floor exist for any pre poll alliance which has the majority the house the single largest party whose alliance has majority the house any other alliance that has majority the house personally can see both sides the argument the governor well within his rights call the single largest party convinced that bjp can get the additional votes legally which where the clear implication encouraging horse trading comes believe the governor clearly the wrong for this and should removed the president however one good thing that the governor did was buy himself some time the last hours there are minor cracks appearing within the ranks the congress with some mlas signatures missing their claim form government this might have led the governor make the decision that did can understand his point view too however has violated the clause avoiding horse trading the bommai verdict and should not allowed stay far the government concerned shall see days the honesty our mlas ,1

 guess nri have been living europe for years now however have not gone modi rally wish had the time would have liked pursuing phd electrical engineering atheist but when was younger took part the rituals just avoid drama don like hindutva politics hate that things like killings over beef are taking place hate the discrimination that dalits muslims and other minoritites face yet bjp supporter being nri and supporting party home dilemma while can vote should because the result not going affect bad for the average resident indian however when you are removed from the mundane politics everyday life and read only what you can from news both indian and foreign you gain more neutral view the situation have met lot indians abroad and wish could say that met lot congress supporters however did not almost every person met supported bjp remember literally only one person who was anti bjp and was from tamil nadu wasnt congress supporter either least this the situation europe maybe the indian community the other parts different why support modi first reason because believe that out all messed politicians the country the best person lead the country right now there were good competitor would open support him but right now don see anyone second reason whatever the state the country the work congress one cannot look what the country today and blame bjp for all its problems strides the situation minorities poverty and such negative aspects plus opening economy increasing literacy disease reduction and such positive aspects are all because congress when one looks all the positives and negatives the last years not all bad but could have been lot better say that certain situations are the result bjp naive however one looks one place where bjp has had long time influence and that gujrat desert one the leading producers certain crops that small achievement and riots again were the result long history violence there under congress rule bjp cannot blamed for that and violence has decreased substantially under bjp rule gujrat third right now people are celebrating the fact that the supreme court has saved democracy karnataka people are convinced the sancticity the supreme court then its judgement modi must also honored how can one celebrate its verdict when favor congress but doubt when favor bjp fourth hearing modi speak only ever talks about development don understand how people accuse him divisive politics when have only ever heard talk about development this leads move away from congress because feel they are lying critisiscm can respect this policy bad for these reasons like shashi tharoors objections government push make hindi language the agreed with congress there however inventing stuff and then critisising like the divisive politics stuff hard digest because the conditions that exist today are the congress making and blaming bjp for feels wrong fifth looking policies the majorities policieslook good from outside again this because one does not feel the effects nri easy praise demonetization and gst from outside because one sees the numbers and feels good without facing the downsides like waiting atm etc and maybe people might criticize demonetization implementation but was actually successful for excercise this scale venezuela tried after india did but could not manage and much smaller country the end nri want the best for the country congress policies seem good would happily support but the moment despite all the negative stuff about bjp still looks better for the country than congress ,1

 first heard about vedanta the context vedanta university orissa think was book feast vultures josy joseph the summary what understood was that vedanta colluded with politicians and acquired over 6000 acres land under the pretext opening world class university but the real intentions were use that land for mining not sure what going with that land that deal was dragged court and getting dragged court but reading about was awesome politicians and superrich make fool people such large scale 6000 acres for university private university private university linked with one the most corrupt corporations was unbelievable and incredible are the idiots ,1

what happened tuticorin unfortunate and sad while agree that vedanta are being completely unethical some arguments the protests seem incorrect like banning ipl people mocking and abusing others for speaking about other issues news most the people from what noticed seem putting the blame modi while the hatred modi justified for the people tamil nadu many seem believe modi the root cause all issues while totally forgetting the fact that the state government completely useless there zero awareness commitment from the state govt and every frickin minister clueless the state ministers had some balls some action could been taken must also realize that rapid industrialization has provided lot employment and still the source livelihood for thousands across the state but the same time realizing that they slowly degraded livelihood and natural resources problem that desperately needs solution shutting down plants allowing newer ones open are currently not the solution ,-1

 love this lot too and noticed this just last night regards baldur’ dialogue but hopefully get game about the gods coming after kratos because they know who and what ’ done mimir knows the legends the ghost sparta surely odin must know too basically want the gods going war with kratos not going war with misunderstanding know that sounds like the first games the series all over again but the way that kratos handles himself against these gods makes more interesting the events the end this game happened the original trilogy kratos would have killed baldur freya and the frost giant his maturity makes his fights more interesting ,1

cracking atreus and mimir being referred boy and head,0
 love the fact that none baldur magnia and moddi know god even when atreus says gods baldur gets killed thinking beaten giant and get killed thinking the last giant als the fact that kratos says let him defeated when magni encounters them the summit beaten while atreus the ass gives the killing blow,1
haven played the game yet they ever find out that kratos actually god and not giant ,-1
 also think ’ interesting that they didn’ even know faye was male female ,1
modi also called atreus half breed because they thought was human giant hybrid the thing hybrid races less while his father thor and extension him and his brother are also hybrids ,-1
that makes lot sense second time playing now and see this thanks ,1
 and here thought you kind was supposed enlightened much better than \ not only are giants smart but think faye was known have giant foresight could mentioning her foresight this line but yea does make think talking about greeks and their philosophies,1
awesome list could clarify that baldur said kratos knew why was there and not play dumb because thought kratos was giant ’ have the eyes one,1
yeah santa monica definitely did good job making those fights personal almost felt his rage with him especially took personal whenever they would threaten atreus and made those spontaneous bursts spartan rage damn satisfying ,1

second spoiler warning you the real mvp bruh,1
great effort hard believe odin doesn’ know about kratos with his ravens and thirst for knowledge ,1
yet another revelation baldur never really comments why his mother freya doesn really attack kratos even when she desperately trying stop him throughout the entire fight baldur never really comments how kratos and freya obviously know each other that would surely weird why earth would giant from norse mythology know greek god however makes complete sense that baldur wouldn think twice about this because him both freya and kratos are giants course they know one another ,-1

you guys have wrong idea about the monetary system the monetary system doesn dispense justice and not fair the system tool create work and build infrastructure the tool were 100 fair ppl would unemployed therefore banks lend money stimulate growth and the trade\ off that the monetary system weakened result \ this deal with the devil and politicians and the rbi and banks are the deal\ makers not the true beneficiaries \ the people benefit through job creation because the people ask for jobs and don ask kicked and made study and create jobs naturally you are fool enough make deals with the devil the dealmakers get rich and you get poor \ that how shady deals work the number one fix for people ask for helpful kick with just enough motivating force that they study \ what need are study boot camps then they can cooperate \ sharing info open src software\ and build better system \ possibly forcing that pay spent within \ months being received wasted converted long term savings \ maybe years the idea that the govt cannot print money except every 6mo 5yr etc this way any losses are isolated that time period and quickly dealt with \ however this won fix the problem \ just makes the problem slightly more manageable\ ,1

because modi government believs legalization corruption and upa was not that smart ,1
 the rbi could not however ostensibly check the tendency banks accommodate existing borrowers giving them additional loans with the hope that the whole loan will not become non performing asset npa its books such accommodative stance banks out systemic compulsion showcase better asset quality led ‘pretend and extend’ and ‘evergreening loans’ surreptitiously entering the banking lexicon much the detriment sustainable profitability banks easy restructuring loans using forbearance asset classification helped banks escape the correct classification advances npas the rbi therefore insists that such divergence disclosed balance sheet footnotes measure transparency that stakeholders can take note source resolution framework for stressed assets challenges and opportunities html ,1

are now saying that rajan was bad banking regulator rbi governor till mid fy17 that the reforms brought about made fraud reporting better ,-1

what the writer seems miss out that banking fraud generally takes \ years mature and for the bank finally figure out that they borrower not going pay its not like that just today morning guy borrows money from the bank and tomorrow tells the bank screw itself what this rti highlights that people are declaring that they cannot repay the loan now this has lot with the stress demo and gst have caused traditional thug biz owners ,1

this subjective opinion the author and the author has worked editorial stuff hindustan times and the telegraph there are more and more reported cases every nature just blaming current government totally biased what the author and many other authors forget mention that india has one billion plus population and there are only 150 policemen per lac citizens similarly the number courts limited all seems from the colonial rule the real issue why there has not been any real police reform and india still using police act from 1861 british created that act for their own rule and use the police force suppressive tool against indian citizens nothing has changed since 1861 say 1947 now the bigger question who will tie the bell cat mean constitutional changes for police judiciary and other important topics without single majority one party both the houses impossible because against the interest any party minority for short term but long term will help india lets have serious discussion about how bring these needed changes ,1

misleading all single use plastic means basically single use cheap plastic like plastic bags maybe plastic water bottles will they really replace all their packaging plastics with renewable materials its only because know lot about plastics and even some our high end aerospace plastic parts worth are considered single use plastics because they dont recycle any not cost efficient checking every recycled batch for consistency and composition which necessary for being rated for use airplanes ,1
great news ,1
well considering only few small states had been able that bit skeptical whether this might the case not but then there harm trying ,-1
indian here this has already been implemented some states like kerala entirely without any hitches also some cities like bangalore and indore where live this has long been policy talking about said place production plastic bags completely banned sometimes their possession punishable fine personal experience matter proper and efficient implementation matter how ignorant the residents may let honest which majority the indian population indore the cleanest city india and proud proud resident can without doubt say that the most beautiful city india the key achieving that was like said efficient implementation once the streets and localities began cleaned regularly and were maintained that way they were awakened and motivated their own keep them that way the basic analogy that people will make already dirty places worse the day but once they have that starting benchmark they will questiom themselves question their principles and refrain from doing the dirty deeds and also help them keep that way ,1
 this gov continues win elections they probably achieve the reason modi gov wins lots state elections that manages deliver got banking for all demonetisation the sob simply abolished 500 1000 notes and nothing happened there was initial hiccup and then the gov went win election after election just smashed through with his idea and came out unscathed universal gas connection instead wood fire for villages and hinterland folks this winning elections for him target million households take member families you have 200 million people affected just the gas cylinder distribution ditto for housing ditto for swachh bharat roads railways one thing modi not short grand sweeping visions and the ability execute just gross numbers would something like countries along with australian population sizes that are impacted his ideas and the 2nd rung leadership are equally capable delivering with equally large vision can you believe that one even thought river barges move goods along the ganges nitin gadgari has set things along with flow control keep the ganges minimum depth for barges move more dams planned water release course they lack money all these things all once,1
they banned plastic bags some 10ish years ago went hilariously tits opposition media cried murder and bags came back let see how this goes ,1
 implemented would have actual impact the rivers that carry percent that trash are the yangtze yellow hai pearl amur mekong indus and ganges delta asia and the niger and nile africa thats off the list ,0
good for india this can implemented and enforced this will hopefully long way towards reducing the trash pollution many their rivers ,1
 love that not just rich western nations leading the way with this the fight against plastic waste needs international effort ,1
good idea but how the hell would they even fund this their fiscal policy terrible ,-1
 wait see implemented but that pretty huge commitment ,1
this can ill you good news when travelled india years ago was shocked the state the rivers the cities they were clogged with plastic you could’ walked across them let’ hope this comes fruition ,-1
this the best could make original will abolish all single use plastic 2022 vows narendra modi reduced bot india will eliminate all single use plastic the country 2022 prime minister narendra modi has announced modi move aims drastically stem the flow plastic from the billion people living the fastest growing economy the world report issued tuesday world environment day showed dozens nations acting cut plastic including ban plastic bags kenya styrofoam sri lanka and the use biodegradable bags china extended summary 23autotldr and comments are monitored constructive feedback welcome top keywords plastic modi world india pledge ,1
 would happy happens but think should and then boast about ,1
while can applaud the desire reduce litter and waste removing all plastics going cause hygiene problem one the biggest reasons for single use items prevent the spread diseases due contaminated surfaces ,-1
these words needs implemented all said none done story india ,0
maybe stop throwing your garbage the ground too ,0
noble but believe when see not going happen ,1
bangalore has already done they instead give cloth bags now which look uch better and lot more durable ,1
plastic waste probably top problems india right now regardless how high mountain was driving through the middle nowhere the middle the night plastic trash was everywhere ,1
well that’ ambitious and will extremely hard that timeline plastics pretty much everything ,1
wow india becoming more environmentally friendly than the great for them and really shows what terrible government have right now ,1
achieving that not problem much doing till 2022 ,1
where live have reusable biodegradable bags people take them with them the store they buy new bags and end with pallet full them like have but this begs the question what was wrong with paper bags for groceries ,1

now that the plastics issue solved how about going after partially burned corpses being dumped rivers esp the ganges poor families can afford enough wood completely burn bodies they just toast them and toss the remains into people drinking and bathing water public crematoriums near the rivers better for the air better for the water better for the people this could improve the environment couple months not years,1
india really bad actually enforcing laws the entire system extremely bribeable still hope that this works especially india has tradition non plastic single use things bowls tried leaves clay chai cups banana leaf plate these make more sense reusables for street food sellers who obviously don have the possibility properly sanitise cups and plates love know how they plan deal with the plastic water bottles though long you ate home you can use filter boil the water however the really hard find safe water without resorting bought water ,1
 indian can confirm this just hollow lie just like putting 100 electric cars 2030 ,-1
hopefully india rural population will educated enough then have developed more healthy understanding why isn good shit the open unfortunately the culture often the opinion that handling shit untouchable work somehow worse than the alternatives ,1
this not gonna happen they will make law that nobody follows like when your year old promises build you nice and big house for next year india country filled with trash and they need get least decent control over that before serving outlandish claims ,1

" this article adblocker unfriendly following the text the article modi neither talks nor looks nor allows talk how long you plan continue the protest • the strike ias officers has stalled many important works concerning the
people delhi the ias officers not attend any meeting convened ministers they not respond phone calls ministers nor they any field visits with ministers extremely strange that soon after our
government was formed delhi the modi government snatched all our powers
concerning the transfers and postings officers today the elected delhi
government cannot take any action officers the officers’ strike has been
instigated the central government paralyse the delhi government what the does not respond your demands • need understand why this officers’ strike was instigated despite
being faced with numerous hurdles created the centre the aap government
has performed wonderfully people are asking the aap government did not

the traditional right left narrative doesn hold true for india right doesn ask for special treatment exclusive only hindus ask for equal treatment all citizens and modi has been party worker all his life even not still party worker doing his part for the country while rahul gandhi born with silver spoon and when asked about his constituency work told the peopel off saying can anything and ask the even otherwise what are his credentials mla these self appointed idiots who call themsleves gaurakshaks don represent the right and finally are you from the southern states and have never suffered have got our culture destroyed invaders they way rest india has think this the reason incidents like the gujarat riots happened may seem silly for thaf they fight over religion but there real suffering and fear behind their actions alienating them not gonna work well only end with idiot like trump then need bring them into the fold and correct their ways ,-1

\ kraustausi vilnių nors esu kaunietė būčiau dėkinga bet kokius būsto rajonų patarimus viskas visada priklauso nuo norisi gyventi arti centro jeigu nėra didelio skirtumo siūlyčiau keltis kokią jeruzalę fabijoniškes pašilaičius ten daug naujos statybos namų krūvos parduotuvių visko gali prireikti netoli namų pliusas gyvenant toliau nuo centro pigensė nuoma tiesa nėra labai daug pigesnė šiek tiek paieškojus galima rasti panašia kaina žirmūnuose antakalnyje šnipiškėse net naujamiestyje apie kiekvieną rajona truputį naujamiestis maždaug puse namų yra seni \ 1970 statybos juose šildymas yra tragiškai brangus tad jeigu toks namas nerenovuotas komunaliniai gali būti itin brangūs dalis namų yra dar senesni tačiau tarpukariu statytų namų šildymo kainos nėra tokios didelės dar derėtų paminėti buvusius fabrikus paverstus loftus kaikurie fabrikų negauna gyvenamojo pastato statuso dėl registruoti gyvenamosios vietos tuose namuose neįmanoma pats ieškodamas buto mačiau daug skelbimų nuomai būtent perdarytų fabrikų tad prieš nuomojantis patariu įsitikinti kad galima tame bute įsiregistruoti kad namas bus aptarnaujamas namų bendrijos naujamiesčio būsto žirmūnai galo daug pensininkų bet pakanakamai patogi vieta mieste geras susisiekimas lygniant naujamiesčiu šiek tiek švaresnis daug žalesnis rajonas kiek žinau didžioji dauguma yra blokiniai tad dėl šildymo yra šiokia tokia loterija žirmūnuose yra nemažai renovuotų namų antakalnis labai didelė dalis namų yra tokie patys seni kaip naujamiestyje rajonas yra prie nuostabaus miško upės jis jaučiasi itin ramus tačiau skirtingai nei per nerį esančiuose žirmūnuose čia gyvena nemažai jaunų žmonių apsigyventi antakalnyje patarčiau tik kur nors netoli šilo tilto kadangi juo važiuoja didelė dalis viešojo transporto link centro kitų rajonų šnipiškės visi gyvenantys tenai sako kad tai vis dar pavojingas rajonas panašiai kaip naujininkai vilniaus vilijampolė šnipiškės savaime mažai kuo išsiskirtų kitų vilniaus rajonų namai blokiniai naujos statybos tačiau yra kelios vietos kur tiesiog nekyla nors net ieškoti buto tai aplink kalvarijų turgų šanchajų ozo devynaukščiuose prie vilniaus licėjaus šnipiškėse turbūt yra mažiausiai žaliųjų erdvių visų rajonų tačiau tai gero geriausias rajonas susisiekimo požiūriu ten viešasis važiuoja parktiškai visur jeruzalė raudonasis vilniaus rajonas didžioji dauguma namų raudonų plytų kaikuriuose namų yra gana brangus šildymas tačiau rajonas yra galo tvarkingas ramus jeruzalėje jau nebevažiuoja troleibusai tačiau negalėčiau sakyti kad ten prastas susisiekimas jeruzalė yra visai šalia gražių takų palei nerį verkių regioninio parko fabijoniškės gero tolimiausias dar senos statybos rajonas jeigu nerūpi miesto centras norsi gyventi pakankamai pigiai fabijoniškės yra logiškas pasirinkimas namai kaip daug kur vilniuje seni blokiniai fabijoniškėse dar monolitinių aukščių yra šildymo kainos vidutiniškos labai nedaug žalių erdvių tačiau yra viskas gali reikėti yra salomėjos nėries pašilaičiai greičiausiai ten jau daugiau naujos statybos namų negu senųjų tai realiai yra miesto pakraštys tad susisiekimas viešuoju transportu gali atrodyti kiek ribotas bet jeigu nerūpi centras šis rajonas naujas jame yra daug viskių verslų darba rasti jame neturėtų būti sunku taip pat reikalingų paslaugų gausu apie kitus rajonus karoliniškės prieš kokius tris metus dirbau tame rajone susidarė įspūdis kad ten mažai kas rūpinasi aplinka galo daug pensininkų geras susisiekimas bet pėstute namo negrįžčiau tiesiog perdidelis narbuto kalnas ypač kuo arčiau narbuto gatvės šeškinė yra viskas labai vidutiniška susisiekimas yra bet kaip karoliniškėmis kalnas vienintelis dalykas kodėl nerekuomenduoju šeškinės kainos didensės negu sakykime žirmūnuose panašiau naujamiesčio kainas bet toli gražu nėra taip arti miesto centro naujininkai sako kad ten reikia turėti ekstremalo savyje turėti bet yra tekę ten vaikščioti tose vietose toliau nuo dzūkų maximos nėra taip jau blogai kainos kiek mažesnės negu kituose rajonuose aplink centrą tiesa namai gerosiose vietose yra senesni kuriuose šildymo kainos didesnės užupis žvėrynas labai nedaug daugiaaukščių žvėrynas panašus žaliakalnį jame aplink labai daug ambasadų vilngio parkas labai gražu patogu bet sąlyginai brangu užupis taip pat gražu patogu sąlyginai brangu markučiai nuosavi namai arba bendrabučiai vienareikšmiškai nėra baisu tačiau niekažką lazdynai rajonas miške ant kalno jeigu atvirai tai nelabai žinau tik tiek kad namai blokiniai \ grįžusi turėsiu deklaruoti seniūnijoje kad gyvenu lietuvoje turiu tai daryti priklausomai nuo vietos kurioje gyvensiu galiu pradžioje prisiregistruoti kaune vėliau tai keisti pagal nuomojamą vietą vilniuje \ darbo birža visiškai nieko apie tai nenusimanau žinau tik tai kad jei grįžusi prisiregistruočiau būtų apmokėtas mano privalomas sveikatos draudimas iki kol rasčiau darbą prašau apšvieskite mane jei taip supratau kai tik deklaruosi grįžimą gyvenamąją vietą deklaruosi čia turėsi pasirodyti veiki tuomet galima stoti darbo biržą jeigu darbo iškart nesiseks rasti darbo birža veikia maždaug taip jeigu nedirbi jie moka sveikatos draudimą jeigu nedeklaruoji bedarbystę sodra atsiunčia prašymą susimokėti jeigu ignoruoji nuskaičiuoja nuo lietuvos bankuose esančios sąskaitos jeigu deklaruoji bedarbystę sodra įsipraeigoja padėti rasti darbą esant norui gali pasiūlyti mokymus ypač jeigu darbuotojų trūksta bedarbystės metu sodra moka bedarbio pašalpą kokio dydžio nežinau ,-1

 just one man and his cabal running the country — the same kind surveillance and pressure the media society and dissidence — what they did gujarat same thing they are doing across the country one man taking all major policy decisions like was gujarat — demonetisation gst this and that you know happening but when guy who used run their media campaign says that bumps the scare factor ,1
 why did you quit the bjp wanted quit the day modi was made the prime ministerial candidate for the party why did you feel that way uncomfortable whatever has happened think know too much was just uncomfortable think that was not good choice bad choice but colleagues said that everybody deserves second chance especially public life and does modi they also said that there are too many checks and balances delhi there supreme court the media more intense the parliament are sure going change give him second choice that felt was sane advice gave him chance waited resigned february 2015 gave him months then when saw that more the same things were happening did the only honourable thing that could done — quit can you explain what you mean same things the same things that were happening gujarat — you know one man and the bureaucrats kind running the show the same thing happening the centre fact one man running the country and another man running the party just one man and his cabal running the country — the same kind surveillance and pressure the media society and dissidence — what they did gujarat same thing they are doing across the country one man taking all major policy decisions like was gujarat — demonetisation gst this and that months could figure out that things will not change precisely this lot were okay with voting for bjp and fact thought that they were the logical choice after upa shenanigans just not under modi and shah announcing him the candidate and the majority support for him just felt like betrayal most people who aren hindus you joined the party 2004 before that 2001 the gujarat riots happened and even before that advani was widely acknowledged the architect unrest that led the babri masjid demolition and the riots that followed you said you wanted something for the country how did you overlook the party communal history didn think there was any logic this violence 2001 was actually extremely proud the fact that vajpayee talked about rajdharma and expressed his disapproval for modi discriminatory politics letter obtained through rti found that rare instance atal behari vajpayee had written modi after the riots reminding him what his job was and that was not fan discrimination another thing that due the intra party politics could not fire modi wanted that flight goa everyone pounced upon him and couldn anything empathised with his handicaps number one was running party coalition his position was not one absolute power within the party think the control the party was still with advani felt wanted things change but couldn change attraction the bjp was not bjp was not rss was vajpayee heh good that they did not let but feel that this response fair guess just saw meaningful job the end the day how would you describe the trajectory the cell the cell trajectory went bit like simi the first president simi who was instrumental starting now professor united states and this banned organisation india started simi with different objective you know help muslim students who were backward using the power education help them progress the founder later said that was the idea behind simi later became banned organisation the cell started with very different mandate was not created abuse people actually think the people who joined 2004 that wasn even the culture the party the bjp used cultured party mean there was some sense some decorum within the party now has crossed all limits would you have advice how fix what the cell has become you cannot fix the cell until you fix the party president savage ,1

 there going big improvement audio latency android over what has already been done oreo with the new audio engine what follows more commentary than question regarding oreo audio engine testing within google should done other devices than just pixels the new audio engine for oreo suffered because this bug oreo made the new audio engine crash oreo the bug was fixed but the bugfix was not picked many manufacturers result most major devices samsung xperia htc huawei suffer from this bug rendering new audio engine for oreo unusable nearly half the devices for contrast oneplus did have the bugfix and worked well with the new audio engine with oreo for this reason oboe only very recently started publicly correcting the earlier claim that they are using new engine for oreo very recently corrected after developers pointed out they would have keep using opensl for oreo oreo new audio engine debuted google 2017 with music demo using the new audio engine this suggested testing devices other than pixel was non existent within google otherwise the claim that oboe worked well with new engine for oreo would not have survived that long ,1
 edit the ama days now feel stupid love the team did ama but you guys are fun too append the questions that would ask them the end have few questions about dark mode firstly are there any plans expand consolidate the multiple settings that currently relate this currently there are three night light the new device theme that affects pixel launcher and the notification shade and the appcompat daynight developer setting exposed the developer previews using xda tasker workaround force device theme follow the night light setting can have all three change consistently myself but prefer first party solution integrated into night light myself secondly nothing that some first party apps are starting implement daynight actually implemented app myself google maps beta now has dark mode splash screen end also noticed mention adding full light dark support material components project also helps that the new google material theme appears lend itself day night theming there anything you can share specifically about the system incorporating daynight specifically looking the settings application bit weird that doesn match the notification shade and launcher theme remember previous ama for the developer preview was said that the notification shade was made white for consistency reasons will see this consistency spread theme devicedefault and the platform settings even first party google apps why the dark device theme much darker than oreo annoyingly hard read when combined with the blue accent color used for icons and text this especially apparent with the volume slider and for other questions what drove the decision completely remove alternative non media volume sliders from the new design know many people applaud the decision make media volume the default but many others have been hurt this change and now cannot adjust ringer volume without opening settings also related why was vibrate and mute decoupled from ringer volume why were the expandable quick setting tiles from oreo removed altogether still unhappy that the battery and data usage graphs from nougat were removed but now even the wifi and bluetooth device lists are gone really don understand why this was removed why there alternative for the old modular not disturb functionality really doesn work well one size fits all mode not being able schedule different levels effectiveness between driving mode and weekly routine not mention manual activation seriously irritating why are the recommended app icons overview different depending whether access from the home screen from within app why the stop showing these notifications banner aggressive many cases want see notifications and dismiss them not every notification meant clicked the google app weather notification comes mind why does toggling invert colors force the notification shade recreate itself this behavior change from oreo why hard access split screen now there really needs gesture activate lastly what the purpose the feature flags developer option end they don appear anything but they appear some sort testing interface built into android systemuigoogle thank you for reading ,1

first all thanks for all the hard work android has really evolved over the years good way love see support for extensions chrome content filters the most annoying thing about android how little effort takes for the screen rotate oneplus has 8gb ram but being used apple ships with 3gb and plenty love see the perform more aggressive memeory management put apps that aren actively being used suspension and free that ram better set developer tools don want worry about the different versions the write code using android api devices that are older than the compiler should just ignore compile time perhaps have the ide let the developer know nothing will happen due using newer api like see something like apple interface builder for android ,1
 did open tracker issue this but for those that are serious daydream users can you please provide way for differentiate daydream apps from other apps the app drawer crazy annoying accidentally launching daydream app when you didn intend and having the screen orientation suddenly turn horizontal and full brightness when the primary way launching daydream apps from within the daydream app launcher itself some apps are good about using the name icon make clear they apps but many apps games especially don make obvious having little daydream indicator some kind the app icon even toggle settings for hiding daydream apps from the app drawer would really beneficial for those with lots regular and daydream apps installed ,1

thanks for doing this ama the first time feel compelled ask questions every android version see change the interface and user interaction this year see the new recents model revamped material theme design lock screen info status bar shifts and new iconography packs have seen and read the design studies and collaborations the new material theming but lot the choices like the new outlined status bar icons feel like change for the sake change even far saying that battery percentage the lock screen adds mobile analog electric driving range anxiety reserve judgment until the final release but these changes stay are going get rationale actual case studies why these choices are made feel design control comfort conveyance and complexion reduction where apple ios still ahead usability and still making big strides material design was great great step the actual look and feel android this case but also for web chromeos and ios apps but google apps and android versions still feel like hodgepodge design choices picking google material theme feels like good step forward unifying all apps under one theme not speaking about interaction models but the difference apps actual choice portray android app possibilities this purpose deliberate choice lack unification and focus one design within google other words will there moment the upcoming future where can expect apps adhere one few interaction models instead free for all mix typography slowly see lot google apps shifting from roboto google sans will this font available through google fonts what the rationale behind the shift from roboto google sans feel literata was font that would well the google fonts for use web designed for displays and why isn used more long reading activities google products the screen cutout part feel android focuses heavily this emptying the center part the status bar what the rationale forcing this choice also users who don have cutout can see that the clock the left non negotiable since you want every android instance have similar but the fact that another phone design one with notch changes interaction model only notifications visible the nav bar the pill step into the future and although have some quarrels with the interaction model think step forward but with the choice moving towards white nav bar for some google apps would have guessed that the nav bar background would disappear like the pill iphone also floating this would fit right material design with similar design the fab when dp1 was released and saw some google apps dropping the navigation drawer was expecting have new interaction model where swipe from the left the screen swipe left the pill would the back gesture and for any app not targeting api level still have nav bar and back button can see problems with this mix interaction models but has this been consideration and how can expect shift more gesture based with these transition periods ,1

hello have few questions related development specific sections android have least years work experience with android but general feels like months instead every single year vectordrawablecompat much like android there are way too many caveats and hacks that have keep looking before manage properly build app vectordrawablecompat feels useless use when you have mess with half the project settings make work for pre lollipop you don want use vector compatibility pre lollipop you have replace all app srccompat with android src avoid getting the error which says that you have enable vector compatibility library for that that would been great you could use anything seen this article about but doesn show any example memory usage and configuration updating issue only the mechanism far noticed some people stackoverflow suggest use appcompatresources getdrawable context drawableres which most likely bypassing the delegate option and causing the same issue mentioned above people will more likely use this works one mentioning what actually doing like anyhow different than contextcompat getdrawable resid and then people will use even though might cause hell pre lollipop there still any other way fix this issue least any example see how does really break older versions and can disable app srccompat don want use fragments animator after whole year working with android still have idea what the correct way use fragments recently stumbled upon problem where supposed flip fragment another fragment with flip animation was hoping that official android documentation would help hide view but there major problem documentation using animator objects support fragments not work with animator objects how supposed use flip animation with support fragments this case can even find example rotation that doesn use animator objects some people say that nineoldandroids library should used for this can you update documentation page use updated animation frametwork instead using animator camera had work with camera1 api once never again even use some library here another surprise the library doesn have that thing that you need and then you have hassle around find way add break and back actual camera api again another case for such library that crashes older versions even minsdk fits the biggest problem here mostly creating actual camera view had adjust aspect ratio orientation cropping preview resolution and what not make somehow work along with complying lifecycle surface textureview activity fragment and camera itself after hoping works check out samsung device broken redo everything again until find out preview size not working well are there any plans for compatibility library for camera make easier use with actual lifecycle along with cameraview avoid constant struggle seeing what the actual proper way load preview this camera outdated and mostly never used content android studio still shows many old resources from gingerbread for compatibility purposes along with that compatibility and google play library contains loads resources that fills the whole list where can pick own resources without digging are there any plans simplifying least filtering resource selection avoid this logcat logcat great use until you get literally unrelated and unremoveable logs like egl emulation that doesn help lot that keep filling the logs instead the ones you wrote want filter those then have create another filter and write package name separately each time for each app cannot pick show only selected application anyhow possible put easier way exclude tags and specify automatically package name from selected application emulator quick boot emulator has been improved for while which good thing personally don want use quick boot option usually disable however the option disable quick boot literally gone some system images like oreo x86 system image but not gone oreo x86 system image this intended and possible add option choose between cold and quick boot this case geocoder this thing broken literally far noticed will fail about out 100 attempts more less even with same identical request does use google maps platform api feels like behavior from google maps api has similar failure rates api key not used are you going remove this though support native have native and support fragments you have decided deprecate fragments android support fragments work all platforms the same way more less while native ones are not nested fragments for example there feature implement something without adding sdk and instead added support library why such feature added sdk anyway and then later due incompatibilites added support library isn easier maintain such feature support library separately simplifying sdk there are loads components that require loads boilerplate make them work properly and solution for that not always obvious one example might asynctask which requires weak reference listener avoid memory leak and requires kept fragment will get destroyed activity unless stored which troubling for just starting single task that may either leak memory reference not cleared properly never reach activity configuration changed destroyed rotation that things just wrong you want stop the task don know how much androidx and ktx will help with this but hope that this will eliminate components that shouldn used anymore and that they can properly replaced with new components without loads trouble and boilerplate them setup are you going deprecate some components that shouldn any longer used and make simplified alternatives performance stability coding whenever work any app want make sure runs properly even lower end phones however when have use workarounds the nerves sometimes cannot handle this still trying create proper architecture make sure that things work and don break but always feels like something missing that something will break the architecture soon later had troubles with fragments but managed work easier with viewmodel and livedata though with sacrifice not using onsaveinstancestate which fragments still hell work with then again you have fragmentmanager that breaks lot you need manage backstack did managed use other library for but still feels like workaround still had some additional workarounds library doesn have some feature that can done with fragmentmanager when comes bad performance google own apps are literally huge size over 100 and methods about 100k 200k methods they stutter many times almost like they perform expensive operations main thread even though they should loaded separate thread and uses loads libraries some things also you look google app open source libraries list you most likely notice load libraries that are used about them what your opinion balancing performance stability and coding practice apps how far should work with boilerplate simplify code how far should optimize avoid any kind stuttering complaints old comment thread basically mess apis pic shows small part png deprecated methods get replaced with methods different name requiring higher api ending with making another wrapper use them setting foreground requires api but documentation says api listeners for software keyboard opening closing actually you can even open close keyboard without some small hack fragments are until you have use them stacks animate them smoothly and saving instance state usually there way get filename path from uri complex hopefully architecture components will help with saving state properly and make async operations easier along with room sqlite persistence don trust 3rd party libraries much when every library has different ways something ending with mess some required feature not implemented and starting all over with hack also don like most articles going hyped with some new library features and suddenly show magical tutorials showing simplest way but not realistic another problem for are outdated tutorials half them give solutions that are longer valid contain code with flaws causing memory leaks unstable functionality final note also apologize couldn express what wanted ask explain tired with working legacy projects that use deprecated api and loads workarounds make work ,1

thanks for doing this have built voip application and are reliant fcm firebase cloud messaging high priority messages with time\ \ live wake the device receive incoming calls when the app the killed background state the following issues are related battery saving wake locks while the issues are not specific android are hoping you could point the right direction sometimes when the device connected the internet loses connection fcm and never receive the notification since the ttl set the notification lost when were using gcm added code send heartbeat messages the gcm server order keep the connection alive heartbeats gcm server how send heartbeat gcm server can something similar for fcm have tested the app using adb doze mode and does receive the call and popup but sometimes when the device has been left idle for long time and not charging the app receives the fcm message but doesn respond until the device touched moved only then does popup and show the incoming call the full wakelock that are using wake the device does not work until the device touched moved there something android earlier that prevents use full wake lock after the device has received high priority fcm notification thanks ,1

this related audio and performance why sustained performance mode denied sample rate different from native typical sample rate khz recent devices use khz for speeding calculations and understand sampling would result minor performance hit but reducing the number frames per second for purposes there significant performance gain which easily offsets sampling khz may also necessary depending the 3rd party libraries used for signal processing don understand why native sample rate enforced audio apps better let the developers choose suitable sample rate and still provide sustained performance mode when requested sustained performance mode very critical for audio apps prevent audio glitches the related question currently sustained performance mode provided only till the window focus case signal processing audio apps would beneficial allow sustaining performance even when the app window not focus but with foreground service notification ,1

imo india has been reeling under this silent emergency for quite some time now all ruling politicians have mastered doublespeak and are afraid criticizing the govt even when its the wrong media state very biased and does not report extensively about things which can land government trouble recently modi had rally jaipur and all party workers were tasked fill the stands they paid people attend the rally show the support commands usual modi launched few schemes and told how now have acche din and the controlled crowd cheered two days prior rally sale black cloth was banned jaipur they feared protests from various groups nobody the media showing the ground reality now have government which believes looking good rather than doing good they have already given hints for their strategy 2019 openly declaring parliament that the opposition can try think removing them 2024 people are brainwashed with their propaganda that they give excuses like congress ruled for years should atleast give bjp years bjp might corrupt but modi not modi has made proud overseas what they dont understand that modi and his coterie has been lying through their teeth openly and misleading the nation this chest thumping culture propagating lies the norm now someone rightly said that democracy people get the leaders they deserve this puts thing into perspective majority the country still supports corruption and getting their job done regardless rules the onus vote out this government choosing for candidates who can bring some change rather than spinning tales during 2002 riots one modi regret was not managing media very well has aptly learned from his mistake and now have country where people are lynched due fake news real issues are swept under the carpet media silenced and nobody gives shit ,1

whenever get idea for shaking meditation and find myself doubting whether should figure why not try once what the harm you may learn something ,0
 how dare you course meditation about creating environment both internally and externally that still enough for you achieve mindfulness satori you prefer why monastery mountaintop why meditate early the morning because easier achieve base level stillness ultimately course the goal remain mindful the presence all kind stimuli and activity but start wherever you need you don start playing instrument playing concerto front audience with piano you might even practice song one hand time and then combine slowly you need introduce the difficulties the practice gradually you are comfortable with meditation these difficulties are just the phenomena life discomfort the body sounds etc eventually try get away from the earplugs but you need them start out then don see why not ,-1
zazen about acceptance with what even disturbing noises are what arises why shut them out just sit earplugs needed,-1
think about japan with for second think tokyo osaka huge sprawling megacities there certainly constant noise hearable these cities cars driving trains passing planes and helicopters flying above people talking and going about their business noisy constantly even during the night and think about the japanese monks and zen laypeople over there you see them sitting there with earplugs doing would way missing the point meditating would say anyway the noise can helper training with noise will end being superior always training total quiet why because what use your mindfulness you when you can only apply the best conditions while nothing all going around you life isn like that and when situation occurs you can just put earplugs either would say you should try without earplugs don think sounds disturbance they aren even noises babies crying and people arguing outside are total accordance with your being disturbance you who are creating rejecting the noises don disturbed the noises they are there let them there ,1
 first out could okay then you progress you could try treating noises that come with equanimity and work seeing that sound just sound and needs not attached ,1
 theory not kosher for zazen however depending your conditions use your best judgment ,1
instead wondering something for meditation ask something for there you find the answer ,0
 not the noises that disturbs you you who disturbed the noises ,0
 know they are great help understand the purpose going without earplugs you are busy city the noise constant why fight and you live out the middle nowhere then they might not unnecessary however where live pretty quiet until isn’ can trying meditate even doing something else and then hellaciously loud vehicle the kind where you’ put your fingers your ears you were outside will drive the neighborhood and immediately rip out whatever was focusing even ’ just cooking have take split second reset granted you might not always have earplugs you there danger becoming attached maybe someday ’ without but for now they are helping ,1
try with both see what feelings arise ,0
use your mind thought read namo butsu namo amitofo namo amitabha namo amitayus form zazen well,0
 okay okay with you your practice and yours alone ,1
zazen itself does not need accept accessories other than the zafu and zabuton the point for you get past external factors case don’ have house and the temperatures here are insane now obligated keep fan next when sit ’ noisy but don’ really notice also zendo’ window right above neighbors’ balconies sometimes they’ out chatting laughing etc still issue you’ probably too focused what’ happening around you ,-1
 become distracted find using body scan from head toe trying imagine the feeling every sensory receptor each point body really help focus back then maybe count breaths from think matter the distraction accessory you use the meditation practice you come back will all the same that bear awareness dead silence find myself focusing the back “hum” what believe basic human awareness hearing like white noise and usually that’ what try focus ,-1
’ okay meditate however you choose meditate ,1
when trying become stronger you don’ lift the heaviest weights first ,1

 johnny johnny yes papa scathing critique called left wing liberalism the boy known johnny allegory for the bourgeoisie class while papa represents liberals who claim watchdogs over the capitalist class johnny steals the sugar obvious metaphor for the stolen value labor think wages profit simply hides behind his back exceedingly obvious that was there but papa turns blind eye however for the purposes creating fake sense that papa trying asks telling lies this representative how liberals through rhetoric pretend curtail the excesses the capitalist class pander working class voters while reality they let the capitalists get away with when papa asks johnny open mouth does seem that trying catch johnny the act however seeing how quickly sugar dissolves telling johnny open his mouth does nothing catch him papa knows this this represents how liberals regulations nothing address the inherent contradictions capitalism the video also addresses bjp and congress supposed antagonism the media portrays them mortal enemies who continually fight each other reality many issues such support ambanis and the division between religious groups and castes which has torn apart communities they agree outside the view voters they mingle and laugh with each other friends similarly johnny and papa dance with each other they sing doo doo doo and finally johnny laughs gets away with the capitalists similarly laugh their yacht parties they get away with extracting profit from the most vulnerable ,-1

the youtube angle good would build your follow base and almost work proof concept watch brand the easiest option work separately from the watchmaker and aftermarket alteration let say 100 1000 watches and have that act your collab this could also used small sample size whichever brand you with that collab watch would work also think could depend the amount watches you order brand may want work with you you gonna order 100 000 pieces from them and act the retailer just two cents ,-1
 listen the “watch and listen” podcast and remember episode were matt weiss owner weiss watches who started out mentions that you ordered certain amount watches through you could customize and potentially make your own limited edition from memory the amount was around the 200 300 but the way was saying was you would have purchase all them and then what you wanted with them not sure how would feel about you marketing their products though anyway just trying help out all the best with this,1
very hard you simply don’ have the brand recognition make happen and would only happen watchmaker reaches out you not vice versa celebs have big media presence and brand power hodinkee has massive brand power within the community and the other collabs out there are largely with famous brands that are rich history like tiffany with patek ferrari with hublot also offense but moda partners network just doesn’ have sexy ring that would draw potential collaborators ,1
flashback those 2014 idiots whining about freebies promises aap ,-1

imo probably one the better options have got there are some good politicians every party but they are undermined but their respective political parties ideology aap came out public agitation was made with public sentiments this government very inexperienced but they want good and evident delhi the support they have the streets delhi the modi government seriously hampered aap lok pal bill its drive curb police corruption when the modi government took that power from aap and gave the delhi was independent state like the rest have doubt that would have been different city state now far aap being the centre doubt they have people experienced enough handel the portfolios will take some time for aap catch and hope gains seat the parliament but the same time hope they don stray from their path feel the best option have got the moment don know can say congress because rahul gandhi just does not feel right and definitely not modi shah government they continue the divide will widen aap will vote for them again think ,1

this comment will probably get buried but would like put something out there and please correct wrong the problem lies all three domains healthcare india administration financing and service delivery there are both private and public health sector india public hospitals were already free and quite affordable other circumstances believe however the problem exists financing and service delivery there some not all public hospitals are not funded well and hence the poor service delivery and long waitings and some cases subpar quality what would like see more funding diverted towards public hospitals and strict regulation how health service delivered the front line this move promising free coverage would just another way attracting votes this seems benefit only private sector becomes free for poor public but then again private sector would need subsidized government pay for the services being used under free healthcare umbrella more likely diverting funding away from public health sectors for balanced budget don seem wrap head around far but hopefully will favour public edit adding after quickly glancing through the linked article seems like also talking about indian handing out 500 000 rupees worth coverage annually poor communities not sure its allotted single individual household either way personally don think capping the medical expenditure that will provided free cost will ideally any good people would still unable use private hospitals fulfill their needs because what corrupted private hospitals overcharge individual one will out r500 000 single hospitalization period without any strict supervision that end that poor person wouldn even able defend their case either because legal fees and all another whole issue not only that r500 000 doesn sound lot when considering the costs treatments and diagnostic tests provided through private hospitals one also looking accommodation transport and unavoidable costs when receiving that medical care especially for person need who belongs remote area common that financially unstable person tends explore public hospitals save that capped medical expenditure service delivery those public hospitals would still the same right now unless administration actually begins finance fund those hospitals aid them deliver quality care ,1
its gonna interesting watch another large scale social healthcare project unfold ,1
wow haven seen topic this polarizing india since the partition,1

 covered what with what money how good the care the fundamental problem with medical insurance that every attempt lower the costs creates incentive raise them the private citizen would pay and insurance then the price rises the more generous the insurance coverage the higher the price rises and faster this happening with healthcare and college expenses the usa the two items that have risen the fastest cost above inflation rate are also the items most heavily subsidized government coincidence hardly ,1
maybe this uninformed statement but just made day see someone power actually doing right the people they govern and are elected represent hope india can deliver this ,1
good for india finally catching china that regard unfortunately indians general have always had very apathetic attitude towards the suffering their compatriots well that just like his karma man even gandhi criticized that his fellow countrymen and without empathy hard for people support policies that help out the less fortunate hope inspiring see that this attitude has apparently changed sufficiently ,1
 useful article,1
comments down here are negative the point ignorant and some comments comparing benefits and problems genuinely trying study the scheme seems like people india don believe government all and live constant state denial ,1
 the united states the only place where scheme indicates that bad the plan has alternative motive ,-1
itt top comments self righteously stating their opinion about healthcare were fact and then people responding with facts that reveal their opinion was misinformed large degree ,1
 weird see this because was just talking about our shitty insurance the said that countries like india will probably get better insurance program before get something like medicaid for all then read this know not everyone that covered but great start happy that people that can afford insurance will able get treatment ,1

can they deliver something like this just buying votes before upcoming election ,0
they will manage just fine free healthcare india will happen ,1
here interesting fact india had free healthcare before insurance companies made appearance the 90s the government hospitals were all free people had wait for serious procedures though and private hospital services were priced reasonably middle class person could walk into private hospital and come out without being bankrupt because the hospitals knew how much the market can afford now years later cost healthcare has gone and not indicative what the market can afford but more indication how much insurance companies can charged private hospitals neglect people who don’ have insurance has become like the for the patient pain have fight every claim with insurance companies ,1

the two units will almost certainly preform indistinguishably from each other during normal use notable differences the topping d30 supports dsd natively and has the switches all the front which many people like prefer the clean look the schiit modi little cheaper has double the warranty period and measures slightly better objective testing just pulled the trigger modi earlier today but will admit that the biggest reason that chose over topping unit for aesthetics matches lyr design and color scheme not size the longer warranty period just made the choice easier make have need for dsd playback and mentioned above personally prefer the power switch the back keep the front panel looking cleaner ,1
 bought d30 last week and was doa the replacement unit also died just days pretty infrequent use was shame because honest loved the little thing heavy nice materials good shape front facing switches that feel great use but not going keep buying them not worth the inconvenience they this unreliable could just have gotten unlucky haven heard any issues with reliability online comparing the d30 dac the difference was slight bordering imperceptible doubt there meaningful difference between the modi and the d30 ,1
get the topping use the dsd playback not get the modi source using modi with vali with dt770 pro and hd58x modi the first product that schiit uses scientific measurements create specifically purchasing spectrum analyzer and the first product that recommended amir audiosciencereview,1

reciting some form refuge take refuge the sangha namo buddhaya namo dharmaya namo sanghaya one favorites called the four immeasurables may all beings happy and have the causes happiness may they free suffering and the causes suffering may they never separated from true happiness that free from suffering may they abide great impartiality free from attachment and aversion prayer can get extensive tibetan style buddhism look famous king aspiration prayers aspiration good actions for example beautiful but admittedly maybe bit much for first date ,1
one the best prayers dedicate the merit you can find different versions you google “dedication merit” however you can also say your own version out loud the end your meditation session you can make spontaneously you want the idea that any benefit virtuous actions like meditation practice easily dissipated you keep the “merit” for yourself like giving money charity — you public way make people admire you — cheapens the act and makes less powerful you may get some immediate compliments and benefits but these are quickly used like the virtuous act drop water the desert — easily dries dedicating the merit you generate the thought and wish that any benefit from your virtuous action any joy enhanced reputation monetary reward spiritual development any other positive result will experienced others much more than yourself this way your virtuous action like taking drop water and putting the ocean — will never dry until the end time the end your practice session just say “may this not for alone learn patience deal with anger may others benefit and learn from actions experience joy may others share may others come contact with any capacity benefit cruel them may they cultivate compassion for generous them may give them the means generous others ” you can make your own more traditional recitation “ this merit may all obtain omniscience may defeat the enemy wrongdoing from the stormy waves birth old age sickness and death from the ocean samsara may free all beings ” ,1
 mantra necessary focus the busy mind prefer something simple that doesn stir the mental waters further something that won generate further thought agitation the idea meditation being still the mind something natural easy personally meaningful that reminds what meditation works well still soft light relaxed one used another focus return the center doing insight meditation then noting takes the place mantras with each gentle noting action taking the form simplistic label the sense door that notice consciousness seeing seeing seeing hearing thinking feeling tasting smelling ,1
thanks for making this was sure misheard some quotes such jiang jun slap which sounded lot like 会疼点 hui teng dianr this will hurt little this will little painful huh but now that someone else has listed out some them make more sense this way and looks like not the only one who thought tiandi zone sounded weird kept thinking does this guy think some anime villain something ,-1

technically never understood the hype for modi has indeed made gujarat into first world country then why aren people flocking there why mumbai the financial capital bangalore the capital chennai the manufacturing capital and gujarat not even the radar have visited ahmedabad for college event the iim there and could not bear the traffic dirt and dust and overall attitude the people iit ahmedabad looks like belongs 1857 with its stone age classroom and hostel architecture and not some modern institute nowhere did see signs any modern development good standard living that time realized that they hype only because modi method actor and get too easily influenced actors who can speak eloquently the only hope had from bjp was that modi would strong leader who could rein antisocial elements however has failed massively this front and the more look him the more seems like amit shah runs the show whereas modi just puppet who blindly reads the lines amit shah gives him and dances his tune never gives unscripted interviews never speaks out public issues seems vanish and then appear suddenly lot the time all this makes seem like this guy robot who being controlled remote somewhere being used because good speaker who can get votes nothing more everything else about him dud that being said who have opposition that can counter him one and fact that the coalition govt voted power then the country will standstill for the next years and swiss bank accounts will fill while the country wealth will from 100 zero the other hand bjp given more years power they will turn india into police state where everyone has dress orange and anyone who speaks out against the govt gets jailed vyapamed the choice between policy paralysis and looting taxpayer money police state and opinion the first one better would rather live poverty than fear can bring the goon party back 2024 once the coalition govt has drained every last penny from india coffers that the goon party can balance some the losses and again 2029 bring the looters back have keep changing ensure that don the extremes poverty extremes police state ,1

 had eye aap about whom had mixed views curious how many young people were like this have friend who was all praise for kejriwal fact was who told the good things about him and got interested kejriwal the first place but for some reason probably the negative vibes got the initial days now staunch bjp modi guy was initially skeptical kejriwal was the company people like ramdev and that maharashtrian gandhian but more read about him the more came respect him still one the few politicians who speaks without rhetoric and gather has done some good things delhi all things considered ,1

’ muslim but never disliked bjp least not much congress guess ’ easy hate you when you’ the government than when you’ the opposition bjp did fine their first near full term 2001 did dislike when modi was named bjp candidate ahead advani someone younger for all the outrage see about trump never committed genocide against community resulting deaths injuries and loss property gujarat’ scale but javed akhtar said that time also believed that power sobers you like did advani during 2001 term when mostly focused business while used regularly make insanely polarising speeches when opposition how wrong both were still don’ dislike bjp only the brand politics modi shah and their hardcore fans first time was outraged was when modi’ hardcore fanatics were labeling government’ critics anti nationals over the last two years modi shah have given many reasons dislike them but have two fundamental issues with them you question bjp government modi they spin criticism against india politicians party members government prime minister etc should never above questioning and criticism ’ like they used teach children not question the parents course you should question your parents question your god also bjp fanatics blindly support bjp 100 the time how this possible bjp fanatics bjp god can nothing wrong people questioning them should burn hell rest the people all political parties india suck lesser all evil ’ vote for but will keep questioning and criticing them keep them check the extent possible like how can you support bjp kathua rape case public lynchings demonetisation assure you 100 congress isn’ supported liberals when they pull shit like this when hear robert vadra corrupt ‘yeah sounds true should put jail ’ when hear jay shah corrupt play the victim and accuse others conspiracy justify harassment against the wire fml modi rules for another years ’ fine with someone else from bjp hopefully less authoritarian and more competent ,-1
 kind liberal terms trade economy and free markets thought modi was hardline administrator who thought bureaucrats were pile shits and fell for the maximum governance minimum government slogan but this government has gone the opposite way and has empowered bureaucrats exert more influence the decision making process the decisions across all ministries are too top down decentralization and accountability lower level institutions for that the modi govt needs voted out majority the very least ,1
 became interested indian politics during the cwg and iac fiasco used think bjp was good option for india even brought into their diatribe against minority appeasement when first became moderator india people did complain about adding bjp supporter sample some statements from around that time problem was with the fact that most india likes term each and every action bjp anti minority and cultivate bias based that point that one should look the issue hand anna protest was vilified because perceived backing the rss that opinion was bogus reason being thrown around congress tomorrow bjp calls for uniform civil law would support however they start limiting rights for non hindus would call them out for and oppose them tooth and nail when was countered with facts and sources was forced reconsider went through the works golwalkar and savarkar and realised that was ill informed and was morally repugnant support ideology that preached the prominence single religion the indian state for congress hold them responsible for most the ills plaguing this country they are the ones who have governed for the maximum amount time and they have ruined quite well actually believe that they have hindered secularism our country rather than help their appeasement select minorities their reservation policies their petty vote bank politics has created divides where none existed top all there rahul gandhi good for nothing fellow whose only claim fame his last name was unaware the difficulties that india had when became independent and didn appreciate the challenges that the young nation faced have now come respect nehru for the strength our democratic and educational institutions and regard him the best that india has had and one the best pms that any new republic has had for rahul gandhi while definitely not bright lad now realise how easy sound smart when you are the opposition least rahul gandhi not religious fundamentalist like modi ,1
opinions are based the leadership opinion bjp still positive because atalji and his fellow comrades like jaswant singh yeshwant sinha arun shourie and because their efforts nation building but views this present bjp were always lower ebb because the often negative personal and baseless attack our leaders past understood that politics you can always concur your opposition ideology views but their slandering nehruji indiraji was not manner you would associate with any dignified person party they tried hide their lack vision issues related economy especially demonetisation and employment through the noise propaganda whoever comes centre after the elections 2019 should rise above these dirty stuffs and look forward solve the major issues related the nation economy people health and infrastructure ,-1
was very optimistic about bjp but boy they fucked aspirations hard never again ,-1
 the where many finally confess how the modi kaka royally screwed them ,1
 used huge bjp fan kid think middle school because was obsessed with vajpayee would around telling relatives vote bjp kerala because was huge vajpayee fan grew older and more aware things distaste for religious fundamentalism meant that opposed bjp principle itself understanding more about their beliefs and history has further cemented that hatred for illustrative purposes would have been against modi even was genuinely good administration and the economy with everything else remaining the same because believe that their authoritarian impulses and anti muslim agenda are genuinely bad for the country and would destroy whatever social progress made post independence back 2012 personally suspicious anyone who are willing throw minorities under the bus for better roads put crudely and quite sad see how many people know irl who take that bargain course also got personal stake this because not hindu and find the notion the hindu rashtra abhorrent still cannot wrap head around the sort people who look shitshows like pakistan and saudi arabia and see model that they like emulate here and vajpayee turned out religious bigot found that out college something when was reading about him sigh things were great when only had doordarshan wonder how generation modi fans would feel decade when they reflect upon his actions with the benefit hindsight assuming don live hindu rashtra then ,1

although have changed the opinion after demonstration and more after they tried defend don see any worthy opposition the same time considering that nota india has value again vote bjp but not have any expectations from them multi party system yet worthy party vote ,1
 went off the government after demonetization and their idiotic ideas justify they made policy announcements days which incredibly scary add your point regarding privatisation education the offers chilling reminder with sally mae student loans now account for trillion dollars there and people spend years their working life paying down regarded one the biggest problems plaguing america along with healthcare privatising education inherently bad idea developing country where only the moneyed class can prosper the easiest way would make rule that those who benifitted from public education would pay extra public education cess that the younger generation receive high quality public education too and india becomes highly educated country ,-1
similar story was the one who used fight with pro aap friends before 2014 they were sceptical crony capitalism when akhlaq was killed was hopeful that modi will outright reign these loonies state will act fair protect secularism then maharashtra government banned meat for some jain festival clearly state was now propagating hindutva became anti modi instantly,1
 have stopped supporting bjp because they are the real crony capitalist they are demanding everything should privatised what the baniya from gujrat and corrupt lawyer without any win have never understood that some the services are there for the nation and not for profit making they failed miserably creating jobs the other hand they have severely cut down the govt jobs agreed that lot the govt workers are lax but why that have they ever tried address the core issue someone has been the same place for years they are meant lazy railways haven recruited any engineer for past years railways dwindling its operations that they need lesser workforce another point fake promises you know all about need elaborate also they have tried hard break the society media has also targeted hindus agreed but these assholes didn make hard for them ganga where clean why industries owner probably donated them and got the chance skip the waste management money expenditure some places they had close the factories which haven they have broken every institution and placed their own puppets just like congress however congress always had maintained integrity the institutions cag head was appointed them only rti has been diluted there are number factors that lead this but lack jobs the major reason ,-1
 have much expectations such disappointment now can even bear hear that madarchod voice even sings nari teri morni realized his strong man image was just creation substance can even hold press conference can give interview without script only chutiya realized weaker than the previous puppet least the weak didn cry the drop hat lost all hope megalomaniac wants his name history changing the currency notes building useless statues but will remember him chtuiya awwal chutiya ,-1
technically don qualify answer this way back hate against modi not bjp from the time the nda rule vajpayee was kalaam sir was our president were school growing with ideals and extreme pride the nation and then came the news the horrific godhra kand which was then followed the riots which for the first time awakened politics remember relative from baroda narrating anecdotes like how after the riots even older muslim man has bow front little hindu kid born pro bjp family pro bjp state couldn help disdain modi interrupting vajpayee his ramrajya press conference this guy face never showed any remorse emotio rather looked too proud when sonia gandhi called him maut saudagar could see the point but when upa came was praying for sonia not become the remember the drama live when sonia listened her antaratma and made way for the reverent economist think was amitabh bachahan who was among the first few public figures talking about modi becoming somehere around 2012 wrote off ridiculous everything that happened the anti incumbency frenzy that year convinced bjp should replace congress but with sushma swaraj arun jaitley lol cringey now but didn know back then that was douchebag when got clear they are gonna rather bring the vile that modi just lost all faith and was dumbfounded the wave student economics tried understand the debatable gujarat model development not bureaucracy which still didn convince yet consoled myself with the prospect manufacturing and infrastrucutre focussed development not disappointed modi because well you need hopeful start with lynchings shook but didn surprise demonetisatiom first looked like strong measure but proved itself the biggest man made disaster the two things however which have made bjp detractor for life yogi and the kathua horror this the face bjp whem they have absolute power and now realise that even they bring softer face like gadakari what not they can never trusted discounting their flagrant communalism the hope development the stupidest trade off which the public keeps making time and again ,1
 but tbf was really young then actually too jumped the anti incumbency train with parents but was always religious skeptic and seeing the bullshit bjp did opened eyes then started becoming politically aware and educated infact this huge reason became atheist really eye opening time overall ,1

who cares their vote bank will wear this case fraud like badge honour and bring them back into power for more ,1

 this seems like extremely biased article from the huffington post read through and don think the government has done anything wrong here firstly the ease doing business rankings are heavily covered the indian media use them barometer judge how well the government doing not the government fault these rankings are taken seriously the voting population and business houses the country secondly the rankings themselves have serious flaws they only consider data from few dozen respondents rather than actual data from the government they also cover only two cities delhi and mumbai rather than the entrie country the government lobbied heavily and correctly imo change the methodology but was unable thirdly the article states that the government implemented reforms like eliminating the need for company seal rubber stamp open bank account and eliminating the need submit cancelled cheque part the employee provident fund application process department revenue eliminated the need for traders submit hard documents and tried improve the capacity the online customs payment gateway the latest report shows the government managed eliminate one step reducing procedures and also seemingly reduced the time required days for delhi and days for mumbai why this wrong the government enacted simple measures improve the ease doing business india they were low hanging fruit easy implement measures which should have been enacted decades ago there nothing wrong with the government focusing ranking its voters consider important and there nothing wrong the reforms implemented the issue lies the way the world bank measures this ranking this has already been highlighted the government and they lobbied change this ranking procedure which has failed not sure where the government has gone wrong and honestly seems like nit picking huffington post print negative news ,-1

more balls than doorknob has ever shown,1
 would suggest trying focusing the breath meditation what most people think when they think meditation you start out sitting with your legs crossed back strait shoulders back like put hands lap comfertable position keep eyes closed and will sometimes put something over eyes that don see light helps with anxiety then you just sort concentrate the breath enters your lungs and then exits extend your mind your body are you contracting muscles relax when thought arises simply say thinking and back the breath our brains think about other things what they just gotta remind yourself that not the goal the moment think about anything except relaxing and focusing your breath hope that helps ,1
 meditate every day train that mind without this nothing else really matters like asking how you lift car off someone foot well you squat and deadlift for months and months and years and years then you position lift that car you don just magically grow the muscles and the know how that moment breathing helps lot often use breath sort reset button feel mind driving around all wacky and shit close eyes and take few breaths some breath fire etc try notice and note opposed experience the sage always confronts difficulties never experiences them ,1
 pray reciting vast aspirations like the samantabhadra prayer aspiration good actions often really help get unstuck from limited perspective shorter but also very powerful may all beings happy and have the cause happiness may they free from suffering and the cause suffering may they never separated from true happiness that free from suffering may they abide great equanimity free from attachment and aversion even just reciting refuge verse just namo buddhaya namo dharmaya namo sanghaya anything accept that broader perspective which easy see that whatever comes and goes mind comes and goes ,1
the hardest part really starting you feel like you have carve out time and worry about not doing the right way find place and time start preferably keep that same time and place next you need like intervention yourself controlled and out breaths counting for each this will trigger your autonomic nervous system you actually telling your body calm can calm that for long time just stop the world any thought you have not good bad just and move through your awareness there really secret need for anything else keep doing and you get the point where one single true exhale all you need being yourself peace ,-1

 the outset you write this everything write here based one assumption that your ultimate goal what you really want out your hobby make better photography but then you get this part the solution obviously stop pursuing many different genres the same time the sooner you can pick your genre and eliminate others the easier will strike gear off your wish list added bonus choosing one genre will help you focus your time and energy you will progress faster your pictures will better your portfolio will more focused and your instagram feed will look more coherent the solution taking better photos not try take those photos you right sense you don even try take wildlife photos then you never need telephoto lens but there obvious problem with that the context talking about you not even talking about gas here goal shoot wildlife then investing long lens isn gas what actually need get the shot want and can get those shots without buying gear you actually need take the photos you want take not gas might gas replacing 300mm with new one every time the manufacturer updates but not buy the first place buying thinking might one day shoot wildlife but then never actually but the basic case wanting shoot something and getting what you need order shoot not the problem that gas identifies also honing niche good advice give pro but for hobbyist just going detract from what they love about the hobby taking photos actively shoot landscapes portraits wildlife macro indoor events the city night and starting dabble astrophotography fun try hand lots different things and able get good shots matter what doing bored tears had stick just one those sooner throw out camera entirely and finally more focused portfolio and coherent instagram feed who cares what does that have with taking good photos just feels like you totally missed the point this point ,1

 literally treat photography gear like gym membership actually part exercise regime taking photographs routinely forces get the fresh air and exercise need understand the gist the piece would say however that while camera capable taking extremely high quality 8x10 photos probably suitable for use magazine style advertising campaigns most commercial applications for photography will demand higher quality than necessary because the gatekeepers can demand higher quality even they don need higher quality photograph market conditions did force upgrade from camera camera for part think best assume your gear cannot pay for upgrade probably not time for upgrade ,1

this 200 accurate learned high school with canon ae1 and simple 50mm lens just shot ton with what had fact were forced only use that set through early college classes could learn the limitations the equipment that the key that many individuals never learn with almost any hobby working pro advanced amateur you learn what gear software processes can save you time allow you more effective being put into pressure situation only having limited kit forces you find the limits your tools and then allows you justify new tools equipment casual photographer doesn rely his gear for income hasn shot extensively that they know what the tools can and cannot this isn bad thing indictment lack ability its just that you don know what you don know photography reliant tools and tools can used different people different ways once you have understanding the limitations you can work around them use the limitations your strengths search for new tool solve that problem tend look new tools being easy fix for larger problem which lack understanding experience this can translate almost anything ride mountain bikes and have bike that way exceeds abilities and talent but had the money buy and enjoy knowing that more capable than always admit that when that the bike simply tolerates the pilot that cannot ride its limits better than the bike that had before and hope get point where can say need new bike for \ \ \ \ \ \ reason that doesn mean that the old bike isn good anymore its just that finally got point where have the abilities and fitness justify and afford new one unfortunately there quick fix for that yet ,1

 been dealing with this ton the past couple months after coming back from recent vacation still first real camera rx100m3 and keep having this nagging thought photos will turn out better had larger sensor the fact that modern smartphone images can almost appear better without pixel peeping than camera what think may fueling the gas tbh taken few pictures that would distinguish photos snapshots this makes believe that subject and composition that can work reading your post definitely reinforces these thoughts and pretty much exactly what needed read thanks for posting your thoughts and ideas ,1
too many words stop buying shit edit clear everything you say true here and should considered thoroughly photographer about buy more gear for any gear intensive hobby profession fact but much comes down mindless consumerism wrapped very loosely the hobby aspect you didn blow your money photography stuff you don need you probably blow something else because are trained buy buy buy buy buy and receive little mental happy jolt from doing ,1

great post this really relevant topic for loads people and applies loads hobbies spent entirely too much camera gear for what still just hobby and ’ honestly just using phone more and more anyway some ways can legitimately difficult tell what’ causing something you want improve your skill the gear can really either but ’ readily admit that didn’ need make all the upgrades did there’ also big difference between unlocking new possibilities with gear and buying convenience went from nikon d7000 canon the high iso performance the have admit convenient can shoot much hand held that couldn’ with the d7000 but really cared could still have made work with the d7000 could over again wouldn’ upgrade but have the now ’ awesome camera and ’ gonna keep using for years there’ something said for piece gear that you know inside out and can reliably use without even needing think about that snazzy new sony might have more technical capability but you aren’ coming from another sony you’ going figuring out how use and establishing your workflow and muscle memory from scratch when went from the old d7000 the missed and messed way more shots for quite while because wasn’ used yet ’ far saying that photos got worse for time can still say some all time favourite photos mine were taken with the lesser camera think the balanced answer simply fine buy something nice you can justify but then actually stick with realize won’ super transformative will mostly just more convenient there’ nothing wrong with buying convenience but can slippery slope ,1
one thing disagree with that you should quickly possible zero your genre and just get gear for that purpose granted amateur hobbyist and have intentions going pro but want shoot all the things have primary focus boudoir nude photography but want shoot landscape why the hell not gas more like when you have tripod for landscape photography but suddenly one that grams lighter comes out and you just gotta upgrade but you mostly street photography yet own tripod that’ not crime agree with you the 5ds 5dmkii big believer buying gear that years old though this isn’ just about photo stuff but almost all electronics vehicles etc what would you rather drive budget 2019 lexus top the line 2014 guarantee you that you’ have more fun with the 2014 think similar applies photo gear not mention the fact that some point you reach the “good enough” state the art where improvements the gear hit diminishing returns ’ rather get extra strobe can shoot more complex lighting setups than slightly more advanced body aside this year bought motorcycle and learned ride gas with motorcycles worse than anything but the best advice saw this said that you’ have more fun riding you get more experience not fancier bike time spent wrenching time spent not riding get out and ride when find myself going down the rabbit hole researching gear try pause and pick the gear have and use instead the time works every time ,1

the point about restricting your genres and subject matter very pertinent feel not much anymore but remember time when practically every other question the question thread was how take astrophotography pictures and bet there are hundreds people out there with rokinon 14mms that they don really use ,1
 lot people talk about how gear doesn matter but some lenses things other lenses won some cameras won take the lenses that what you want your photos that being said you don know what you trying get out the image you should stick trying master available light sources one ever regretted working that ,1
 don know just but buy lot cameras not for better photos but for better experience even spend quite bit getting xpan sold eventually love the range finder style shooting now looking get ricoh gr3 for fixed lens small pocket size camera for stealth and simple camera ugh,1
 overcame using something along these lines have d750 and will most likely have for next years this will first time kept camera for years with shutter rating 150k and rate 10k pictures year that year camera this because all the camera owned since 2009 when took this hobby canon fuji sony nikon shot them all realize camera not going make take better pictures yes had advances low light high iso sensors but the end the day eye that will get the pictures that want this why sticking with d750 for the foreseeable future fair use sony rx100v5 and iphone well plus think are the verge dslr going bye bye favor mirrorless don think mirrorless there yet but the future ,1
great post once you’ advanced past gas you can really understand what’ lacking your photography and start improving ,1
nice write hope least few including myself can take some the things you suggested and rethink how they really want proceed ,1
high quality gear cheap buy 2nd hand sell for the same you paid average consumer quality products are the real money sink investing crop gear just admitting you like burning money ,1
interesting point that better equipment tends have better photos because used more experienced photographers never actually come across that point before the end the day good photo made good composition doesn matter the focus bit soft you have some vignetting because you used cheap lens you have bit too much iso noise because you using cheaper smaller sensor these are technical aspects which can make the difference between good and great photo this where people seem get hung arguing about technical details like corner sharpness particular lens about battery life dual card slots doesn matter you have dual card slots you can take good photo you just saving shit photo cards now good battery just allows you take more bad photos doesn matter how sharp the corners are not good photo like the argument about sony not releasing lens today there are photos out there that are good because they were shot good photo shot will still look good was shot just possibly not quite good not trying say here that narrow dof and bokeh makes good photo fact that brings common pitfall that many beginners fall into they get fast lens usually fast 50mm 85mm and shoot everything wide open they paid all this money get fast aperture after all would waste not use course there are few situations where equipment makes the photo for instance macro photography super telephotos for wildlife photography although there are lot good wildlife photos taken using spotting scopes instead proper telephotos ,1
 reply will probably get buried but dude thanks for writing this post really made think been gas for while and while recognize never really snapped out the bit about time really got spend every single night watching photography youtube videos when could shooting macro inside editing whatever but that part that really hit home was the gym membership and that because was reading this post workout home had gym membership workout with heavy barbells but went maybe twice week got fed and decided buy measly barbell dumbbell equipment use home working out 100 potential but maybe and actually working out every day made more progress the past months than ever did gym had the perfect example right front face and didn realize thank you much for pointing out ,1

 like gas allows play with cool looking pieces technology that can even something useful and understandable mom every now and then what doing about acquire film gear cheaper looks better and can even disassemble and look all the low tech smartness with some understanding sure actually need take picture something probably grab d750 but the cameras older than myself are just much fun play with ,1

fun fact the term gas actually originated from once active guitar forum called harmony central that frequented over decade ago the originally stood for guitar and was then expanded gear include amps and accessories ,1

 love this not have gas but husband convinced that professional should have wholeheartedly disagree with him but that doesn stop him from getting case have enough plate without spending all time reading every article about every piece new equipment that constantly being released have need little research and get what would best fill need but don need constantly learning new equipment when what have gets the job done older equipment that you know inside and out infinitely better than the newest state the art equipment that totally foreign thank you for the insightful post the subject ,1
 one the best things you can escape the never ending treadmill gas stay away from the news sources that are constantly trying sell you more stuff best part for have done that long ago and never looked back site like fstoppers and petapixel focus gear because the easiest delivering quality content about photography requires more time and effort overall really good post well done ,1

these two paragraphs are the most important this entire writeup are you lusting after canon 5ds before you convince yourself that you really really need this camera remind yourself that few short years ago the canon 5dmkii was state the art was used world famous photographers shoot anything from vogue covers billboards national geographic features there are millions fantastic images out there that were taken with this camera six years later these images still look amazing galleries and coffee table books images from the 5dmkii are still proudly displayed the portfolios your biggest photography heroes think about that ’ their portfolios you back just few more years you’ find world press photo winners and acclaimed magnum series that were shot with cameras like the top the line nikon d2x case you forgot that camera had megapixel crop sensor and maximum extended iso 3200 you own modern entry level dslr you probably have double those specs plus live view and video and god knows what else your lowly d5300 better than what the best photographers the world had the early 2000s and they were taking some excellent photos back then many people the questions thread saying their t6i due for upgrade because old and need full frame while not being able explain why when you ask they quickly google crop full frame and skim few articles then come back the questions thread reply and say better low light performance they also think that cameras are like computers and need upgraded every year two not understanding that nothing changes with camera software that requires updated hardware camera that takes excellent photos today will still take excellent photos years those two paragraphs nail that concept really well that said this entire writeup extremely well written and valuable thank you for contributing lilgreenrosetta ,1
the paragraph that described the moment avoiding the hard work just put focus the backlog thousands photos from multiple trips some are fun shoot star trail light painting hdr brackets hard work just doing rudimentary processing every new problem run into more research google much easier play with new toys can even start working the projects have head cause that only add backlog ,1
 think healthier approach gear acquisition evaluating your needs honestly and asking yourself what you actually stand gain from upgrading switching camera systems getting new lenses only switched once nikon d3300 fujifilm and this was after being convinced that would jump onto the sony bandwagon because all the emphasis full frame camera size and overall cost but here were the things considered shoot street landscape and travel wanted smaller camera because the bulkiness the dslr set was deterring from actually bringing everywhere and thus was not taking many photos all didn need full frame not print sell large prints post sometimes and already decided wanted less weight size glass bigger period enjoy the physical act clicking dials pressing shutter buttons and have small hands buying gear this case was about having better experience enjoying photography and had nothing with getting better photos being better photographer think better use your time and money spend traveling which find makes photography more enjoyable and encourages you shoot more ,1

this one hit pretty hard for had and have many different hobbies and gear aquisition always fun and exciting but you make very valid point can definitely get the way improving the art skill know had opportunities out for the day and take some photos but decided something else because was waiting new lens some other gear personal obsession high iso performance because night owl and pictures are taken night full complement fast primes but dream dual native iso camera that take clean pictures 3200 6400 iso but just years ago would have been thrilled have the quality that currently 3200 6400 iso perhaps time take break from and youtube reviews and spend that time out and about ,1
 know you said you probably didn think about everybody with this post but feel like you leaving out bird photography especially birds flight somebody who discovered m43 like stay this size camera and continue photograph birds got itch get least 20mp higher and better iso performance have cleaner image tracking important you want net better shots well managed learn pretty well the camera have and use the best abilities most the work you setting yourself get the shot but the end result leaves leaving more desired such higher resolution and longer higher quality focal lengths with good been grappling with old tokina 400mm for the better part the year and before that 300mm for about three years this with olympus mk1 when these two lenses shine they really shine but majority the time getting lot misses with this said don think wrong have desire for olympus 300 panasonic 100 400 ,1
excellent post and agree with everything except for one the solution obviously stop pursuing many different genres the same time don think that good advice for hobbyists for professional you pretty much have find yourself niche today you want make any money but you hobbyist keeping this diverse probably very healthy find ways save money without giving interests kind like how thomas heaton answered this question about landscape photography though best gear buy get better landscape photos camper van ,1
the truth some hobbyists are photography enthusiasts some are camera enthusiasts both are but they overlap ,0
 everything write here based one assumption that your ultimate goal what you really want out your hobby make better photography everything that helps that goal good everything that hinders bad just putting out there that this isn the case for everyone personally what utmost importance that derive enjoyment from photography for learning about new gear understanding how works playing around with spending unhealthy amounts time playing with things like calibration targets and different mosaicing algorithms all part the fun and ultimately serves goals this means invalidates your point but feel important know that there are multiple groups people see people dismissive gear sometimes but those who care about should able discuss ,1
 issue that impuslive spender especially this time year dont known photography way for stop buying junk don need its just making buy more expensive equipment that might not use have say though have pretty solid set mostly from impulse purchases feel like was asked shoot sports event outdoor portrait session and awards ceremony back back feel have all the equipment smallish gear pack wouldn say this hinders photography ability but definitely living outside means right now and need real back little ,1
 little silly suggest that all time spent reading about gear could otherwise spent shooting rather think reading about photography stuff can way extend one pleasure the hobby times when not shooting ,-1
 the flip side having the right gear does make taking the photo you want easier you won find many news photographers using 5dmkii now that the 5ds out why better camera and makes easier get the photos they want also some niches are extremely difficult without the right gear you just aren going take bird pictures without fast body and good supertele same for sports astrophotography going difficult without good fast flat field lens whether that wide field long lens you want those types photography there really isn alternative splashing out for proper gear mom superzoom isn going cut ,1

just playing devil advocate there are definitely good things about indulging gear that you may not absolutely need when you buy the same gear that your favorite photographer using and your pics still look very off comparison much easier see deduce what missing the end all you might realize that you need step your understanding light but maybe would have taken lot longer make this realization had you not bought better camera lens speaking from personal experience there are some lenses spent many years and countless hours daydreaming over looking the specs charts and samples images when finally got realized that the lens quite limited the type photography that enjoy had got the lens years earlier could have saved those countless hours daydreaming the what ifs there lot more learn from piece gear when you actually use and own top learning use properly you may learn where falls short that reviewer may never talk about for example might the ultimate lens the type image can provide but maybe impractical use that particular setting maybe just too heavy carry around for that type shoot and experience from purchasing mistakes may help you make better decisions the future instead spending countless hours daydreaming gear and finding workarounds use your existing gear just get may the right decision might turn out bad purchase that you might have sell off loss but learning how use different piece gear the new understanding why something like this won didn work out you hoped will worth the purchase ,1
well said ,0
 had through gas but taught lot didn know that spending money isn smart way improve one photography there was time was naive actually believed better camera was going turn into better photographer thankfully only took few years and few thousand dollars realize the truth the old masters needed box some chemicals lots patience and maybe mule carry all they could make photo couldn get anywhere close quality increasingly fancy cameras weren improving photos figure kai pro photographer cheap camera challenge the old days digitalrev also helped realize that limitations and old gear can part the fun sometimes tell people things might disagree with like they genuinely serious about photography buy the best and newest camera they can afford even they only starting out because wish had done that only save few purchases the way the ladder and also because having the best capabilities increases the breadth one learning curve there still much not satisfied with photography but haven bought any silly photography gadgets long time guess that means growing though did move from canon sony which was sizable investment but that was more about canon crippling their cameras capabilities and specs making them useless professionally which still very mad them for but that another story for another day folks who are just getting into photography don buy too much stuff but experiment lot build softboxes out cardboard and foil use bed sheet window diffuser flash bounce outside 5am take your photos instead noon all the things the one thing the only thing guaranteed improve your photography taking lots and lots pictures will make you gifted photographer like all art some people are just more naturally talented and harder working than everyone else included but you will get better capturing moment and snapping picture ,1

lusting over the but even had the money buy one right now wait until d5300 dead and not dying any time soon stranger gas had that phase when came guitars and guitar pedals would sell old guitar buy new one after realizing only end bedroom guitarist sold last electric guitar and multifx pedal and just kept acoustic which years old you said cameras today are generally more than enough for the average photographer just hobbyist not pro with career feel like lenses are much better investment but that can also lead gas itself what need though flash unit and transceiver that can start integrating flash shots ,1

 think this great advice for amateurs but you interested doing photos video business the startup costs are only 000 000 which heck lot less than what lot businesses cost start don understand the people who spend all sorts money tuition for photography film school and then have entry level equipment you serious about doing for living buy the nice pro gear and start earning money seen friends blow lot money various failed businesses you only spend 000 and fail and you still have all the gear that not the biggest loss the word ,1
great read and obviously suffer from this just got home with even though already had but let just play the devils advocate here but gear matters can look instagram feed and clearly see when from the mobile phone entry level aps and then again when jump pro level camera and lastly when started using fast primes instead 105 the photographer did not change but gear mattered lot the autofocus actually works the focus peeking mirrorless cheat focus the zebras tell you when you are probably blowing something out make for less overexposed areas the ibis makes things not blur and the sharpness primes makes almost everything good out the box just being impressive all these things made take better pictures matter the subject sum numbers the keeper rate with the good gear times bigger than with the crap one you can preach all you want about composition and feel but gear does not matter once you reach certain plateau where crap lenses and crap bodies hold you back even you make work until then upgrade that iii can tell from experience that way way way better than your camera take buy all the gear you want you have the money make informed decisions happy don’ limit yourself single kind photography you don’ want resell all the lenses that you don’ use you’ find the one that fits and then you can start saving your money ,1

 sort cured this finding fun getting the most out limited toolset funny say this when currently using a7r and the which far from limited but also important remember that unless photo out focus people don care about the sharpness value sharpness the most photos with lots foliage textures filling the frame otherwise lot less interested especially when comes wide open sharpness most photos are stopped down some degree which makes most lenses compete with lenses much more expensive ,1

 don really think any use viewing countries good bad countries are countries they arbitrary legal boundaries and the inhabitants and land within those boundaries don really believe there anything achieved quantifying how good they are have say that think there are some major issues within the culture though for one thing india was voted one poll the worst country which woman now don agree with the result that poll think there are worse countries for women course but anywhere near the bottom indicates pretty enormous systemic issues that desperately need fixed addition think pretty dismissive just blame the rape numbers population there are plenty countries with large population densities which don have such issue with rape plus the numbers reported rape are one thing but that doesn include the numbers people who don report rape for instance sweden had very large surge rapes not long ago but was only because that was the same year that they redefined the legal definition rape general don entirely understand why but india has opinion very unhealthy relationship with sex not saying all indians but pretty much all women know have had regularly very uncomfortable interactions with indian men trying hit them proposition them for sex send them uncomfortable messages has basically come the stage that almost stereotype lot western countries would assume that has something with having relatively conservative attitude towards sex and dating idk all know that there uncanny amount women who had similar experiences the phone scammers thing understand but you have get why people the western world would have their opinions influenced that get about scam calls from india per month and extremely fucking annoying plus the people who really fall for these scams are the elderly and the vulnerable course people aren super fond india this regard one thing very much agree with though the cultural damage which was done the country through colonisation which the rest the world seems conveniently forget lot the time basically don hate india indians think that india bad country but think has some very serious issues which need addressed and lot the issues people have with the country aren entirely unfounded ,-1

seeing lot confusion about the concept trends wins and what they constitute try and explain short since early the morning the officials start counting votes from each evm don know how many they count from once but they need lots rounds count them all and meanwhile the votes that have already been counted are displayed which are known trends the trends show which party ahead others particular constituency which why more votes are counted the party with the most votes that constituency can change does lot times what are seeing this time news channels are the number seats each party has the highest number votes far these can change more votes are counted sooner later the officials will done with all the rounds constituencies and then news channels will also show how many seats each party has won the number won seats which determine whether party has majority assembly not and then further horse trading after results are out course why they show trends they don matter the end not entirely sure either think combination trying keep transparency while counting votes not sure about this particular and news channels having half day broadcasting material that the political equivalent badminton match where the viewer glued see the shuttlecock jump from one court another you have any questions glad answer able ,1

great shot next time though please straighten that horizon  ,1
they say atreus’ eyes glow gold summons the serpent stop thamur though don’ know that’ true not and much love this game don’ think can run through again just for that scene,1
yeah found the watched the final boss fight again youtube and yup they sure did ,1
very nice and enough detailed explanation for anyone who completed the game and wants summary this post should stickied,1
according the role the one who loses one arm tyr fenrir bites his arm off although kratos losing one arm and have berserk like implant would good story element ,1
well done boy did the world serpent recognize atreus because his eventual father ,0
 \ kratos brings atreus freya still don know who has called the serpent while kratos and boi were under the witch house ,0
 detail you’ got wrong kratos didn’ midgard leave his past behind fenrir skoll and hati showed and dragged him there seemingly the wolves took action start ragnarok early edit see someone else had already pointed this out sorry,-1
right that the misdirection the devs were talking about isn until you beat the game that you realize was looking for faye not kratos they even have the runewall fragment from the end the game hidden during the first boss fight with baldur have find the dev stream pretty cool seeing them talk about all the things they hid the first mins that pretty much spell out the whole game ,1
great summary one thing really missed how the hell jotunheim devastated and all the giants are dead was pretty sure odin found way there ,1
kratos apparently didn’ come midgard his own but skol and haati were sent odin bring kratos there the novelization according many posts ’ seen this sub ,1
just heads odin and thor are not brothers thor one odins sons magni and modi are thors sons and odins grandsons ,0
 don think there evidence odin didnt tell him who was looking for just never says out loud kratos bit stretch say anything else behind that just because doesn say otherwise besides that all looks accurate ,1
mimir stories say that groa the knowledge keeper foretold ragnarok and then odin sought hoard every ounce prophecy and knowledge since killing groa and taking her library faye kept futher deeper prophecy herself not letting out the prophecy ,0
 deceased nordic god war tyr thought tyr was chained odin and thor mural could alive baldur attempts bring atreus asgard beleive wants asgard get someone able kill kratos,1
thank you much maybe wrong but think baldur want learn how break the spell went kratos thinking was giant thank you again ,-1
nice thank you for this ,1
great write but always assumed that when baldur died the long winter came and finally felt snow didn’ summon was just amazed the feeling cold snow ,1
great summary thank you very much for this having played spider man and rdr2 the meantime almost forgot how truly amazing this world and story are favourite game far this generation and any other for that matter ,1
 like what you have here but can’ correct simply because you failed mention tyr all and throughout the game ’ made very apparent that whatever the “big picture” tyr played major role setting ,-1
 very nice read thanks for summarizing this great game lore ,1
this post absolutely amazing man ,1
thank you very much just completed the story and this was very nice read thanks again well done ,1
 doesn’ seem like odin baldur know who faye simply that there giant who the guardian the portal jotunheim,0
\ knowing now that odin after them kratos and atreus begin their journey along the way they meet freya who hides her identity from them she gives them both runic which apparently imo hides them from odin this probably tracking rune that why she found them the black breath,-1
man now want play again  great post man ,1
 morbidly excited for kratos death,1
this great ,1
well done boi ,0
this awesome loved the start ,1
nanowrimo all over again geeez this stuff for the books man ,0

thx improper demonitization ,0
 wise extrapolate anything from such limited data were these constituencies likely vote for party were politicians and trying win lost cause seats swing seats just preaching the choir did they increase their vote share did win more votes less than last time after campaigned there regardless outcome these headlines just further build the politics personality narrative and are pretty much useless imo but just mildly interested politics what know ,1
these type figures don tell you anything the party loses the states and someone campaigns all the closest districts then they will lose 100 the constituencies but doesn mean they lost because one person correlation not causation ,-1
ache din jane wale hai,0
hahahahaha love how the tables have turned ,1
 hum karein karein kya bole bole kya ,0
taklu has better ratio than modi ,1
don mean bummer but wouldn have campaigned more swing constituencies ,1
 yogi was the fall guy ,0
time for adarniae yogi stand ,0
 modi had spent much time governing does campaigning then bjp would have performed better ,1
but but arnab said bjp was losing rajasthan badly and modi last minute campaign helped bjp give tough fight ,-1
 ghar shadi hai paise nehi hai hahaha still searching where the fun the sentence ,1
what the statistics for rahul gandhi ,0
mitron modiji responsible take fix rbi cbi supreme court and also travel the world meet with any autocrat ready meet him where did have the time campaign ,1
how did they win seats where kaka campaigned telangana did campaign 200 seats ,1
laugh people laugh,1
one question about baldur believing kratos giant assumed baldur’ opening statement about ‘your kind was supposed much smarter enlightened’ was referring greeks odin knew about the greek pantheon and mimir least knew the death the pantheon odin was also least aware laufey and she was renowned figure opposing odin when baldur saw the second bed figured took sign was harboring her assume least knew her identity ,1
array lol ,1
correlation not causation basic rule statistics applies modi rahul everyone ,0
 india just anti bjp subreddit ,0
and only where yogiji spoke thus proven please make yogiji the new ,1
when fighting with baldur the top the mountain says like tought needed you but turns out the boy the brain that point knows kratos not the giant dont get why freya spit mimir ,1
question does kratos kill magni resurrection valhalla because the power kill gods from pandora box because the world serpent venom his axe other thing modi dead was atreus who did the killing blow dead dead went valhalla hel thing valkyries you defeated them all before the final after returning from jotunheim mimir informs that freya has question him where are her valkyrie wings certanily kill kratos with them ,-1
 never considered the rune that freya gives them her house could prevent odin from locating kratos and atreus interesting theory thank you for the post ,1
yeah that different but this isn why play warframe ,0
 karorpati farmers tax tree because agricultural income poor farmers pay tax all agricultural consumables and cold storage but get farm loan waivers every year salaried employees earning barely enough meet the inflationary prices pay full income tax with cess and gst top and pay inflated petrol electricity bills and get ghanta subsidy health insurance life insurance because don belong that bracket salaried class the most exploited group that why pinches much when our tax money goes waste funding corporate tax cuts bank npas and 1000s crores show off projects sala sab side gand hamari lagti hai have lost all faith the political class and now make sure vote for the opposition every single year matter what party ,1
 from the upper middle class was hopeful this government till 2016 but now have decided not vote for this government they introduced ltcg over 1lakh epf was reduced gradually from from 2016 2018 introduction kkc and other cess jobs have actually decreased gdp lies fact upa2 was better \ \ \ don care about religion workers from other religion were uncomfortable all know why ,-1
the third front that kcr proposed must happen for indian politics not for 2019 but atleast for 2024 later long there are just two options people will get fucked over great see non congress non bjp government the center sometime don think there time for happen 2019 most parties are aligning with congress but this idea stays relevant for the next years can happen and that would huge win for democracy now politics india democracy game between two parties playing the game together ,1
only the middle class this guy hasn done anything except give contract ambani rest the stuff that apparently did like gst was initiated during congress time just cut the ribbon the only thing that was bjp specific thing was the hare brained mind numbingly stupid thing called demonetization cash back and higher than ever this guy removed the symptoms but not the root cause even elementary kid would have said that removing money won anything unless you tackle corruption the bureaucracy first didn lift finger against corrupt babus and bureaucrats just did one time clean the dirt that had accumulated over decade but kakaji you leave the window open the dirt will come back the next day maybe some that chest muscle should travel upwards where really matters the thing about congress they quite open about the fact that they looters and scammers and have interest doing anything for the middle class all they care about minority appeasement and waiving farmer loan using taxpayer money and filling their coffers giving fake infrastructure projects their shell companies they will loot the country dry the next years and the economy will crash deficit will increase sky high and infrastructure projects will move forward even then the middle class has voted for them just shows the level disillusionment with kakaji gormint ,-1

you people are delusional you think bjp will lose 2019 you think people have any choice vote for whom apart from modi rahul gandhi who the other candidate show one who has shown any promise congress has start working today wants save face 2024 winning few states very good start but the central leadership has step and provide solid second option ,1
 might probably bring law for ram mandir get votes hinduvita his last card get votes ,0
 cannot express how much joy felt reading this finally the middle class realising what mistake electing religious xenophobic wannabe dictator was hopefully next election can send mudi obscurity ,1
modi doesn have anything for the middle class the middle class india the most committed voters modi modi can keep ignoring the middle class but cannot ignore farmers the crony capitalists because farmers ignored will not vote for modi and cronies ignored will pull back the funding modi has done enough for the cronies his term take care the funding now the last push towards the 2019 elections expect him announce some real goodies for the farmers swing their votes towards him the gullible urban middle class ofcourse can always handled with propaganda that contains perfect mix jumlas communalism and fake news ,1
 was expecting this opinion fluff piece but actually makes some good points the urban middle class saw modi leader who could fulfil their aspirations and were willing hedge their hopes him but there now overriding impression among them that the prime minister — and really boils down him owing the strong leader image that modi has carved for himself — has taken them for granted perhaps driven belief that they have other alternative this has resulted sense alienation and this sense alienation has deepened gradually over the past four years the salaried professionals feel deceived the fact that the modi government has not touched section 80c related deductions income tax slabs beyond tinkering the edges and has instead piled the cesses act that has been interpreted penalising the backers for their support this lack even token appreciation has aggravated the adverse sentiment against the modi government and many are inclined vote against the bjp just teach the party lesson small business owners are aggrieved that demonetisation forced change their operations and that grievance has been heightened due the patchy implementation the goods and services tax gst many this category are grappling with the complexity the process file returns and are ending swelling the kitty chartered accountants who seem the only tribe not complaining while the gst has failed simplify the process for traders and business owners has not been able bring down the taxes enough for consumers many whom feel that unfair tax white goods such washing machines refrigerators storage water heaters etc high percent when these are necessities not luxuries there also palpable discontent over high fuel prices and high interest rates combined with low returns small savings schemes ,1
 middle class bjp and now that congress govt state has started term with the most stupid decision possible those idiots also literally have universal collection politicians ,-1

this what people who compare modi 2014 campaign with trump campaign fail realise trump campaigned platform explicit xenophobia racism and sexism didn hide anything about and that why most likely will win again because there was little scope losing hope him for his base modi was different him and his party history aside his campaign was the back huge anti incumbency against congress upa and modi came promising jobs and development and better standard living excluding minor dog whistling never ran hindutva candidate ever and big portion the who voted for him did because they wanted corruption free government that worked for the people the youth wanted jobs and controlled inflation prices the farmers wanted respectable wage for their year long hard work and what did modi let the hindutva crazies run loose and they started killing muslims and lynching dalits for their cow slaughter did the great leader much open his mouth the right time nope when did condemn those people was either too late too meek and each time the sangh parivar fired back that had disappointed them ended erecting government show and drama government theater which lacked any substance there many things could have done with majority everywhere except the rajya sabha but did not people are sick nehru and the congress being blamed for everything sick his lies sick his narcissism sick his refusal even acknowledge the negative aspects demonetisation sick him and his ministers trying brow beat every government organisation into submission people are absolutely disillusioned totally feel like 2019 going huge shock modi and vajpayee had good government and was far better leader and still lost 2004 don surprised this pompous ass and his team arrogant assholes lose again least will forced form minority government 2019 here hoping for good days ,-1

 this sense betrayal might anecdotal — based the experience daily drudgery unmet expectations — but palpable discontent that rising anecdotally would say that middle class voters are finally feeling moral repugnance against this regime that old whatsapp uncle who shamelessly shared communal bigotry the past now cursing the bjp for playing communal politics most whatsapp uncles haven change though and are still cunts this probably exception think polarization hasn changed much just the opposition has voted little more strongly than before remember that modi only won some national seats even with his big wave 2014 underestimate the numbers people who voted against him every election ,1

again anecdotal but have seen people who now hate him the most transformation was friend who made his small son shout modi modi modi outside the polling booth that day 2014 the demonetisation happened his company had downsize and lost his job now hates him the core and the whole family going vote against modi his wife side family too because they had cover for his emi some others are still spreading bullshit about wonders modi doing and all that assume their opinions have not changed everyone who voted for modi 2014 not going vote for him again but everyone who did not vote for modi then also not going vote for him this time the vote share will only shrink and opposition gets its act right all modi has left months ,-1

the states gujarat madhya pradesh rajasthan and chattisgarh and maharashtra all gave almost percentage more seats which adds around 160 seats not more 2014 this won replicable 2019 and bjp has not made significant progress the southern eastern states therefore majority government bjp highly unlikely though modi going out power too unlikely the moment what afraid that the limited time left there might politically motivated communal conflict the hindu heartland gain ground most likely they have bjp govt still the govt power sticks democratic means 220 seats lok sabha need around 275 for majority will huge achievement ,-1
 kinda wish the backside didn have the gratuitous butt window all characters showing off their ass when the outfit naturally does fine but this just cutting hole perfectly good trenchcoat for the sake ,1
 was the fault middle class elect genocide creator 2002 gujarat there was infact gujarat model speak off was from day one propaganda gujarat farmers were distress primary education was tatters few jewellers from stuart got rich due blood diamond and people went crazy that modi excelled administration people took mainstream news face value that they failed verify modi claims cuz wanted alternative congress should learn from this rss sangh vhp and bjp are poison for this country ,1
 the only one who thinks the textures look obviously fucked the first one looks like her ass folding over and clipping into itself maybe they overcompensated but seriously doubt this supposed censorship think the original either caused was caused model errors and they wanted fix ,-1

 the loan waiver critics loan waiver structurally solves issues but there structural solution the current agrarian crisis that can passed with unanimous consent and have immediate effect yes need structural reforms however what the meantime that over the india population that severely economically distressed due combination bad noneconomic decisions like demonitization who they were hit the worst and bad agrarian practices irrigation systems take years build require land laws reform things that are electoral cancer for now you also mention giving loan waivers farmers somehow economically harmful the middle class yet you are less incensed relatively perhaps what the left loves call the loan waivers for the rich justification for economic growth however agriculture large part our gdp well and who exactly the person who cries out when your onion prices and tomato prices rise most our corporate business sops are poorly managed and companies that exploit our natural resources and wealth increase their wealth lot due nepotism don have tax sops for actual growth companies that provide real growth killing off local companies like micromaxx etc making impossible run hardware startups taxing angel investors you have immediate solution that could solve the agrarian distress for now please let know interested knowing what counter policy you have immediate loan waiver for the short term during the duration the kind long term necessary reforms required reform the sector towards profitability also about the argument that middle class subsidises agriculture fail see why that bad considering how inefficient agriculture practices india are the food prices should crazy expensive comparable global standards the farmers were actually educated employ efficient methods and latest tech however still see majority the people who arent the top percent not purchasing imported food products why that its because your subsidies inherently benefit you least until there are structural reforms you not live the top tax states maharashtra delhi tamil nadu etc and are middle class how you justify the grumblings from people these states that they are subsidizing your backward states how does feel cast aside then and what are the counter arguments you would make that case why shouldn similar arguments apply the case famers ,-1

 modi hasn’ held single press conference taken open questions the last four and half years but that ship has sailed ’ not big deal anymore however this episode further reaffirms feelings the popular belief that our doesn’ have college degree because you went indian college the least you would learn how fudge your way through questions which you skipped preparing for education has taught one thing confidently repeat per cent the question that posed you until you can use the word “because” “the government only busy collecting tax all manner and all ways from the middle class and they not get the relaxation they were hoping for sector loan processing procedure and bank transaction fees and penalty because…” this method succeeds boring the person who posed the question enough make them automatically lose interest the answer post “because” you can literally get away with saying anything trust because have degree industrial engineering just writing zoological names monkeys thermodynamics paper this the best article have read today coudn any funnier ,1

few things note here congress really wants turn this their favour quite obvious there will crazy lone wolves running around crying foul will glad the congress leadership spokespersons cms mps and mlas stay shut this case hence atleast showing tolerance akin the freedom expression the where there are ton troll videos showing donald trump buffoon most notably the snl sketches alec baldwin congress leadership should attempt give any kind importance this movie this will ensure there will clear provocation from the right wing bring some kind response but congress should absolutely stay shut not attend any news media any interviews this topic even they want they should just acknowledge the movie will released and maintain notion that movies not depict what happened singh should call press briefing and with sonia gandhi and rahul his side show unity and transparency and not uncertainty also would news cycle for free singh and rahul gandhi goes this movie cinema hall just give itches the bjp clearly shows rahul okay with the expression fictional events ,1

 haven read the book but friend has and said the dialogues mentioned the trailer weren the books and that they exaggerated the friction between sonia and mms the producer the movie recently met the the bollywood delegation and the actor portraying mms sympathizer the present govt there are also other nationalistic feel good movies lined just prior the election all this has convinced that the movies are more line with propaganda than art entertainment ,1
the only reason know its pro bjp have not read the book because know cbfc head actor and viral social media clips extraordinaire anupam kher there had chance being accurate kher would trashtalking twitter,1

 you have read sanjaya barry book you will find his story lot more believable than other versions upa era floating around tldr the book sonia made mms not out some act greatness but took strategic decision which all are well aware throughout the upa she kept cutting mms down size constantly interfering his job and because his reluctance don the limelight however mms handled his job very well upa felt very strongly for the nuclear deal and this led breakdown upa left uneasy alliance mms staked the existence his govt nuclear and the party led sonia followed him into the battle however reluctantly the high this victory meant that mms came into his own and led upa victory 2009 however miscalculated not insisting fighting for lok sabha himself since was the hero 2009 victory unlike 2004 should have asked for greater arm space however upa was the undoing mms the great victor 2009 and the biggest contribution came from the party and the family leading hope they have done justice the book while making the movie however given how overdone kher mannersims mms look the first glance surprised they have ,1

 think this will effect large part people because movie has large audience rather than book based book this movie releases after election guess will the best time one off topic thing people who doesnt support bjp does not mean they support rahul gandhi ,1
 have read the book the accidental prime minister which the movie based written sanjay baru who was working with from 2004 2008 the book always shown good light trying prove the point that was one the most honest and corruption free heading the most corrupt government book focuses how managed one the most unnatural coalition upa the book nowhere baru has insulted shown him bad light infact trying establish the fact that was hardworking person battling against his own party elites gandhi family book also focuses diplomatic ability manmohan singh explaining the way pulled nuclear deal with usa while handling criticism from his own allies ,1

hah didn know our was funding library afghanistan apart from our other projects there until this came out guess should build another library white house and enroll trump for subscription ,-1
 you rather read something wholesome instead the newest instance trump embarrassing himself here article about afghan college girl studying the who managed set library her community school afghanistan global search for edu 12411538 html although sajia darwish only junior mount holyoke college massachusetts she has accomplished more than most entire lifetime darwish driven two things first her love her home country place devastated war poverty illiteracy and extremism the name religion and second passion for learning yet despite all the challenges her dedication justice and progress through literacy gave her the strength overcome innumerable obstacles and open baale parwaz library bpl this summer kabul afghanistan clarification since some folks appear have misunderstood comment this girl story has nothing with trump utterance other than the general topic libraries afghanistan ,1
public and societal education and learning are anathema for trump and his republican horde stupidity ,-1
seeing how trump can’ read ’ not surprising that incapable understanding why libraries are important ,1
you fuckers voted for him hope that makes you proud ,1
 afghan american fuck yourself trump,-1
because trump can read ,0
 just jealous because can read ,0
building library afghanistan better than dropping mother bomb mountains ,1
just clear apart from the offensive nature the statement probably made that funding library part misunderstood misremembered from the article was unclear which project trump was referring but india has committed billion assistance afghanistan since led forces toppled the extremist taliban regime after the sept 2001 attacks projects have included the reconstruction elite high school kabul and scholarships india for 000 afghan students each year the only article about some other country funding library afghanistan could find about germany district public library come balkh with german funding,1
trump then suggested build mcdonalds instead ,0
more political cartoon from the same cartoonist lang ,1
this exactly why this man needs kicked out office the has spent billions afghanistan and yet trump has the audacity mock india for just funding library ,1
 know not right criticise but that fat orange fuck bit cunt ,-1

lol his presidency use ,1
this actually pretty hilarious afghans and rural republican voters actually share lot common for example love for collecting assault rifles gun culture costs lives and use whatsoever for books ,1
finally trump telling something that isn blatant lie that right books are use for him everyone can tell who needs books when you have very very large brain ,1
well cheetolini can probably barely read him sure its waste ,1
 just don get why does care about this all ,0
trump never finished book let alone sentence ,0
you need remember that has comprehension libraries since can’ read ,0
you can say not representative ,0
 like how mocks libraries the irony that when presidents leave office they set library but donald doesn read books well donny doesn read will have more fox news talks about president donald trump video library and there will many this how those empty blockbusters are revived ,1
 would total waste for him,-1
 course use him functionally illiterate and half ass senile ,-1

looking trump history pretty certain that even modi mentioned all these projects him trump would cherry pick the phrase built library way belittle india efforts broader point india doing lot for afghanistan terms developmental projects president wants belittle that effort that him ,1
from article trump brought india aid during rambling press appearance cabinet meeting defended his push for the united states invest less overseas while stating that got along with modi trump said the indian leader was constantly telling built library afghanistan you know what that that like five hours what spend trump said and supposed say thank you for the library don know who using afghanistan trump said ,-1
the guy who needs pictures his daily briefing thinks brown people can’ read ’ shocked ,-1
 perfectly rational statement from man who never read book during his entire life ,1
 makes perfect sense when this comes from president whose reading limited reading documents that have mcnuggets their main topic ,1
trump can read really wouldn understand ,1
what fucking idiot,-1
 right knows just going destroyed the taliban when they finally retake afghanistan ,1
 grandfather worked kabul back when the ruskis were still around there was one the executive engineers building hospital there for the indian govt then taliban rpg landed their front yard and sliced through half their furniture they moved back india soon after that and bombing the indian embassy dude kept small table with its leg sliced clean off souvenir ,-1
yes that will make them feel very safe ,1
the absolute irony this very statement ,1
 think most these are wannabes who say this for attention ’ tough bjp and get the limelight without saying communal and hatred remarks you belong particular niche party you must provide showcase the best what the party about this post wouldn’ have happened said will provide jobs apologizes for indians feeling unsafe and promises better safer india this remark what got him attention his plan worked but ’ just theory ,1

 interesting see that publicly spews out but considered bullshit however his constituency has majoritarian viewpoint the more the elected members parliament say shit like this the more understand what majority their constituents think and believe about such issues and such statement are only becoming more and more common its indicator which are casually ignoring while laughing this while muslims these constituencies are genuinely and legitimately fear for their lives ,1
bjp mla say more ,1
 the laughing stock our country because morons like him ,-1

devi denunciarlo quel carabiniere polizziotto corotto deve andare gallera edit vogliono fargli una multa 700 per aver comprato una macchina all estero italiano residente all estero deve rimanere esilio non mai sentito questa legge salvini che proibisce macchine straniere italia una legge impossibile ,0
cosa detto esattamente tuo amico carabiniere hey collega non fare cazzone che qua ragione g0ndsman reato portarsi amico che finga poliziotto ,0
 più grave questo che multa che hanno dato altro giorno può starci che agente troppo zelante ignorante faccia una multa che non sta cielo terra errori commettiamo tutti sul lavoro per peggio trattamento preferenziale per annullamento una multa chiederlo altro carabiniere comunque tutto bene quel che finisce bene quando fermano controllano generalità chiamano centrale danno tuoi dati per verificare chi sei hai pendenze ecc dubito che non abbiano tuoi dati anagrafici ,0
ergo che tre amici caramba vado con loro ridanno auto soldi pure taralli olio dello zio ,1
 sempre vago sospetto che volessero fregarti quei soldi dividerli fra tutti membri della caserma presenza agente polizia semplicemente dissuasi dal farlo hai ripreso maltolto ,0
 come per gli animali senso appartenenza gruppo conta piu della legge quando costretti scegliere nelle forze armate polizia componente animale ancora piu forte tanto che tra colleghi puo arrivare tranquillamente coprirsi anche per errori reati gravissimi,0
per secondo punto intendi dire mezzo alla strada può accettare maniera schematica una persona precedenti meno intendi questo loro hanno risposto che non può fare hanno detto una fesseria inoltre controlli fanno sia sulla macchina che sulle persona nel caso della tua macchina che non ricordo male targa francese può solo esclusivamente accertare che sia stata inserita nella banca dati schengen come rubata stop meno male che alla fine hai risolto hai trovato sottufficiale capace,1
verrò downvotato all inferno sicuro non vedo quale sia problema nell offesa alle forze dell ordine qui problema non era chiaramente solo individuo cosa ripetuta anche col secondo ufficiale ovvio non estendo tutti rimane una vergogna che sia voluto collega perché servizio cittadino oramai optional spero non ricapitino cose del genere ,0
vogliamo sapere accento dei carabinieri coinvolti ,0
 posso confermare che alla radio non fanno altro che controllare dati anagrafici,0
should buy this game ,-1
buon rientro paese civile ,0
celeste there too that wonderful ,1
totally deserved addicting game factorio levels addicting ,-1
che schifo ahahah basta amichetto giusto risolve tutto allora erano vere quelle storie che raccontava mio amico avevano fermato ubriaco alla guida hanno letto cognome nei documenti gli hanno chiesto era figlio del maresciallo risposta affermativa pacca sulla spalla hanno lasciato andare ,0
 allucinante che forze dell’ordine non conoscano memoria regolamenti applicare praticamente loro lavoro non sai farlo dovresti essere licenziato pieno bravi ragazzi con maggior voglia impegnarsi con più umiltà che vorrebbero fare poliziotto carabiniere,0
 potresti raccontare meglio storia del bancomat questa cosa inquieta ,0
essendo figlio padre carabiniere sento dire che verissimo che colleghi sono molto spesso ignoranti sul farsi troppo ignoranti questo problema cui dovrebbe lavorare tantissimo buona parte delle volte hanno che fare con gente merda qua giù sud sono posti cui veramente hanno tutti atteggiamenti criminali incalliti nei confronti delle guardie sono così con tutti non sempre facile capire una persona buona loro mestiere lavoro come tutti gli altri livello gruppo sociale intendo capita fare favori trattarsi bene ambito lavorativo becchi figlio del tuo collega commettere infrazione non semplice fargli multa ciò che fatto creerebbero contrasti interni non questione ciò che giusto fare una difficoltà diversa database ogni azione registrata motivata non include tutti fermati soltanto gli schedati correggetemi sbaglio diciamo che conoscendo questi meccanismi sempre avuto successo nel parlare trattare con forze dell ordine basta parlare nel modo giusto ,0
 come fai avere documenti don vecchia residenza patente non residenza ,0
" scusi perché non volevi offendere tutte forze dell ordine tuo racconto non aiuta
",0
 con modi che riserverei criminali incalliti questo problema della giustizia italiana con forze dell ordine che interfacciano senza distinzione tra popolazione con modi bruschi gli incensurati sono prede facili per tribunali che rifanno dei casini che combinano con pregiudicati problema fondo che nostro sistema legislativo non interpretativo nelle sue parti quindi giudici applicano alla lettera vari codici ergo dipingendo tutti con stesso pennello tutto ciò non crea incentivo alle persone comportarsi bene perchè alla fine anche gli innocenti sono visti sotto una luce colpevolezza ,1
holy shit congrats tynan amazing having followed this game from the start ,1

you would have heard this sort thing any time the past hundred years you listed the right doors early flying saucer conspiracy folk were big vimanas george adamski 1953 what new the admission this sort nonsense major science conferences this though less sign the dilution science and more the use conferences and other state sponsored events are propaganda vehicles nationalism always over reaches itself claiming all manner nonsense for the nation here example ,1

reminds the fundamentalists who claim that the bible came with the idea that the earth round that the earth “floats” space despite the latter being wrong but that’ another topic and other modern discoveries maybe the vedas had something that was impossible misinterpret like “using cells that can take the characteristics other cells can used ” ’ believe him ,-1
this what happens when you combine the belief karma and reincarnation makes some people believe that they are born into wealth and privilege because they deserved and that they could wrong the corollary being that bad things happen people are poor because they deserve not from actions this life but maybe another ’ the entire basis caste system and shitting “the dirty” can see this extending into out culture must the best too ,-1
they couldn even see stem cell back then let alone study them ridiculous ,-1

they also claimed have discovered indoor plumbing toilets and daily washing but this day have chosen not implement them ,0
your brain nationalism let not forget nationalism isn for westerns only indeed most western countries are probably less nationalistic than the world general because education that promotes skepticism against nationalistic narratives projects that promote tolerance and multiculturalism and the memory wwii ,1
nationalists are insecure and ignorant scum the world over ,-1
even they did doesn seem like they did much with just having idea isn the same inventing something lots people have thought the idea time travel but one know have has made happen yet ,1
canadian perspective everything was invented india everything was invented china everything was invented europe everything was invented america something’ not adding here people ,0
having higher entry price for indie game and zero sales certainly doesn hurt when you don ever put game sale people who buy tend more research into the game before buying and not just buy impulse meaning you more likely get players who will actually review your game positively ,1
this the best could make original scientists claim ancient hindus invented stem cell research dismiss einstein reduced bot the organisers major indian science conference distanced themselves sunday from speakers who used the prestigious event dismiss einstein discoveries and claim ancient hindus invented stem cell research this year congress the head southern indian university cited ancient hindu text proof that stem cell research was discovered the subcontinent thousands years ago india stranger prominent figures citing ancient hindu texts like the puranas and vedas ironclad evidence the country technological prowess extended summary 23autotldr and comments are monitored constructive feedback welcome top keywords hindu ancient india year scientist ,1

rimworld have gave big hope that indie games can manage industry future the will only valuable times microtransactions and mobile games ,0

 picked this game because this post had been wish list for long time decided shit get off the pot simple game sometimes frustrating but never dull first run through was stuck with survivor that didn want any labor around the settlement harvesting hauling cutting vegetation everyone died within the hour not big sim real time strategy games however you classify this game there learning curve for but you learn from mistakes and gets better each time and never really the same run always different personalities situations and challenges that keep fresh plus doesn take much disk space and simple enough that installed surface pro glorified tablet and runs great can play whenever want recommend this game anyone that wants get out rut from playing the same old shooters and try your luck help these misfits survive ,-1

not surprising india has long and glorious history and culture which has pretty much been swept aside over the last four centuries being under the thumb western powers and for the hindus before that the period mughal rule all this has led definite feeling inferiority not fun history read you are hindu especially regarding what once was couple this with the period are entering where \ \ lot\ \ countries are showing really stupid nationalist tendencies and where india and china another ancient giant that has spent the last few centuries the shadow other powers and this natural illogical feeling ,-1
liberals are gay,1
 amazing you release good fully finished game and surprise successful and people love ,1
why does this matter anyone ,0
’ said before and ’ say again science flawed scientific “facts” which are taken are debunked new scientific “facts” structure the atom from plum pudding model the planetary model cannot certain about anything the current scientific theory subject just the best theory that are able arrive this point there could better theories that can explain the future ,1
 stem cell researchers agree this signals hindu change and unless you are stem cell researcher keep your yap shut and park yourself with the anti stem deniers heretics and apostates will build stem new deal and make the crackers pay for ,1
religion and science are both just stories pick the story you like neither “true” ,1
 kind hated maybe was expecting too much maybe not smart enough had google how make refrigeration house and that was too much work for honestly then all people died think would like more the controls systems were more intuitive ,1
not even talking about opinion the game girlfriend med student endless hours studying and not gamer all love with rimworld the only game she bought after playing computer she has like different save files some which are experiments with mechanics and some are actual play throughs she knows statistics fucking heart afraid won long before start seeing posters shirtless tynan sylvester her place ,-1

"
rimworld okay your mentality when approaching games about perfection platinum status completing the game don play this you won like you like city base building games where you can expect predictably positive outcomes your engagement then this game definitely not for you you are happy being frustrated the game being unfair losing fun then might great time for you typically when playing games there comes point where your expertise the game makes easy that will never happen with this game ",-1
very first game rimworld played had people and dog one guy will call him barry became intensely bonded with the dog raiders soon came and the dog died defending his friend from attacker barry became horribly depressed didn know cleaning corpses was thing the dog body just laid around the people became hungry and decided maybe barry would feel connected the dog eating made him wasn hungry anymore but was sadder darker the next day was hungry and made him eat the dog again then again the third day his mental state was completely shattered refused any chores even construction which was fond just laid the floor then barry died don remember what happened the other people but started another game almost immediately ,-1

 know this post somewhat old but think ’ worth mentioning that faye the one who painted all those ledges and climbable cracks the walls that kratos and atreus have get past and follow she knew every step their journey and went and painted their path for them help guide them their journey she had that before meeting kratos can only assume think ’ brilliant detail because allows the game devs provide that help the players but justifies through the story and since ’ actually hint about the ending makes even cleverer book ,1

politics india terms electoral choice moribund the and that why such efforts turn out not have significant long lasting results while bjp openly hindu nationalist capitalist party the other national party inc which thankfully lacks that element isn much different terms long term policy positions both parties announce social programs that end ultimately serving mostly the bureaucracy and contractors due endemic corruption while security apparatus and foreign policy positions are identical small parties less said the better still possible mobilize lot people partly because such strikes means general holiday for the middle class who are happy take paid day off daily wage earners who form the vast majority the labor force and are not organized any meaningful way get screwed royally quite few ways these strikes end harming the large unorganized labor and many whom continue participate economic activity regardless strikes unless there curfew something farmers will continue their farming critical winter crop time right now domestic helps will continue doing their jobs mostly shops and restaurants that close the political party power can create credible threat violence have been excited was anything even remotely approaching yellow vest going france which actually seems having some impact yeah skeptical source lived india till the age ,1

okay highly doubt the world largest strike history restricted few areas not all india even mumbai and friends hadn even heard until days ago strikes like this are dime dozen india have idea why this particular one became popular tldr fake news most certainly not largest history,1
this seems grossly exaggerated ,-1
the strike over was two day strike that took place tuesday and wednesday everyone questioning the number every year india does hold the world largest strikes all time the last one had some 150 180 million take part and this one was expected top that sounds impressive but rarely the strikes achieve their outcomes their scale more consequence india population and the extreme size its working class but nonetheless the fact that government haven responded adequately and that the media hasn covered with enough seriousness all point huge worker undercurrent the nation ,1

not kratos loki loki fathers fenrir who kills odin and swallows the sun and devours worlds jormungandr who kills thor and floods midgard and hel the goddess death who marches the legions the unworthy dead upon asgard battle with the einherjar loki kills baldr who goes helheim and hel side when she marches asgard baldr becomes the new allfather this will loki triumph not kratos ,-1

 like the ideas you have your theory but you making lot big assumptions based little info especially about the roman pantheon because have idea how much time has passed there will even romans the god war universe the god death part your theory good but that was the case kratos would god multiple things since killed most the gods the greek pantheon think the reason that kratos will able affect ragnarok because time travel will used there already evidence time travel throughout the story the walls jotunheim and the story thor knocking the world serpent into the past know that kratos has used time travel before god war and the fates help him against the greek gods with the hints the story gives about time travel think very likely that will use again against the norse gods atreus will when becomes loki think this plays nicely into the theory floating around about kratos being tyr with the evidence being that the final mural jotunheim shows kratos missing his right hand which tyr also missing the original mythos the game based there are lot holes the kratos tyr theory such baldur freya and the other gods not recognizing kratos tyr since they had met tyr before kratos but think time travel will help explain those plot holes and this the direction the series will that kratos can pantheons other cultures tyr and fight their gods ,1

does atreus’ name being loki make big difference don’ know much about greek mythology always thought loki was thor’ brother shouts marvel but that doesn’ seem true god war ,1
you had till you started saying draws power from other pantheons ,-1
 think like most your post except for the parts about atreus ring kept alive and the roman pantheon being why kratos has changed not sure there any substantial evidence that kratos kept atreus alive and seems like kind leap the reason why kratos acts the way does now because reflective and regretful many his actions previous games the unnecessary slaughter the destruction whole world the name revenge and the loss the only things ever cared for child wife brother pandora mother are things doesn want experience again now mastered his temper rarely not calm and guards his son with his life ,1
kratos ragnarok this game think and think odin thor freya and other gods death will directly affected kratos and believe loki atreus will also die the latter games and kratos might have indirect hand this the mural shown the end the game though shows the opposite ,-1
 prefer the theory that kratos killing the fates gow2 unbound him from fate entirely and makes him exempt from prophecy much neater and less convoluted explanation for why can affect ragnarok ,1
 now while this could taken metaphorical would like put forward the idea this twice gods kratos holy shit but then considering all the gods killed that theory were hold universally would the god many other things well ,-1
wouldn that give him the powers all the grecian pantheon considering killed them all ,-1
just wanna start saying this one the cooler write ups and theories read here disagree about needing worship have power that bologna for few reasons imo don agree with anything roman you spoke either insert spiderman pointing jpg also say that kratos has undergone some serious character evolution dislike when people try foresee the next games plots and explain with god war war kill war the god war but the god war not him real life analogous situation would the secdef every secdef has different policies also kind fuck you the writers creators you think they wrote game character who can through much but void personal growth that leads into the god death theory what the god death used those powers saw fit moving into the next series assuming egypt many their gods seem based living things could see plot opening with the idea you presented,1

good theory but the snake proof that kratos didn change anything ragnarok enevatability matter how you try and stop will happen plus kratos can free fenrir make the serpent poison the world they are the kids loki plus kratos isn god death cause killed his just god norse mythology doesn have death god exept hel who loki daughter they are clearly changing this for their own story but the world serpent proves that matter what kratos does will change ragnarok plus his wife knows will die thor and loki will travel and train cause ragnarok and kratos knows can stop ,1

great post personally had the same issues the author for different reasons compared the pure life sutras the bible and found the bible more reliable did the nembutsu for long time and felt marginal difference but once started praying changed much and met now coworker who grew south korea and converted from buddhism christianity talking her made think lot also have always leaned more toward theism not gonna say know everything about either faith change practice subjective and admit feel guilt and like cheating amida sometimes but find christianity clearer and more fulfilling not 100 sold and will continue experimenting and eventually church and see how feel there well try find buddhist group but think good buddhists and good christians look and act pretty similar the end both can learn from each other try mix practices really wish could just both pure land and christian but will need make choice eventually ,1

first the author conclusion that buddhism lacks selfless love wrong straight out the gate really couldn more wrong the whole ideal bodhisattva help all beings attain enlightenment there other way become buddha than that buddhas and bodhisattvas are definition motivated selfless love half the realization emptiness selfless love compassion there emptiness without compassion even the context the theravadan example they posted how the offerings the laity monks not selfless love they are freely giving themselves and their possessions someone else not selfless love because the recipients are monks that doesn make any sense will admit that some the faults they find with jodo shinshu are somewhat valid but not because think they are true but because think they are very common misconceptions arrive shin buddhism part the mahayana has all the selfless love and everything else associated with the mahayana whole but the emphasis even evil person being able reach the pure land can hard understand and can seem very christiany there also the idea shin buddhism that you immediately attain buddhahood upon birth the pure land can sound like you don have anything but say amida name one time honestly don think shinran ever actually meant that you would immediately become buddha upon rebirth and think certain passages his writings are misinterpreted towards that conclusion frankly this why never stuck with jodo shinshu don think modern shin teachings entirely line with what shinran was saying this partly because shinran writings are incredibly dense and difficult parse which another reason was dissatisfying the issue one repetition the comment entirely misunderstood you don say once and get saved you have receive faith first and this usually gained through daily recitation and deep listening investigating the teachings and your own reality when you really realize your bombu nature your inability help yourself that what opens your heart receive faith shin buddhism that moment your faith stabilized and frankly this faith should make you better person doesn just give you free pass let you disassociate something supposed allow you build and recognize fuller picture your own flawed reality you can really recognize and accept yourself warts and all that the moment you can begin change and change without overbearing sense guilt you might get from christianity and that what shin buddhism aiming you can recognize your faults how can you become better person but honestly think all these issues could have been avoided the author the comment had been familiar with other pure land schools like jodo shu mainland pure land rather than shin shin rather unique some its interpretations other school teaches that you will attain buddhahood upon rebirth and opinion the notion rather silly and contradicts pretty much the entirety buddhism other schools not place the emphasis one own inability that makes sound like you don need change have selfless love don think any these things interpreted the comment are truly part shin buddhism but they are common misinterpretations with the way commonly taught ,1
excellent point keep mind that everything well mind exist within the buddha mind just the buddha exists within our mind people want know amitabha metaphorical concept for internal state being actual objective thing that exists somewhere his own realm existence the answer both trapped the prison eternity and the only limits our experience are what what can possibly conceived mind even though the hard limits our reality defined our experience existence during this lifetime may seem rather finite this only just our corner the sandbox there are numerous realms world systems universes etc assuming that see hear smell taste and touch here this planet the all end all limit what possible incredibly ego centric assumption akin early thinkers who assumed that the earth was the center the universe and the sun revolved around what know valid but the sum total human knowledge hardly the boundary what possible ,1

the buddhas and bodhisattvas are very compassionate towards like their only concern they can necessarily much about how our karmas ripen but they for sure cheer and they for sure offer shoulder cry where need one and they offer their blessing emotionally speaking the issue often not much whether the refuge jewels love but whether can open them enough touch that love bit touchy subject for many people least touchy word but prayer can helpful here there many traditional texts often recite this short prayer padmakara enlightened vision but you can course also pray your own words one teachers has suggested that shouting help will just turn the buddhas wordlessly just saying their name namo amituofo namo amituofo namo amituofo that actually complete path itself really they will answer even they had actually been answering already loooong before ever even thought ask ,1

for keep mind that the buddha and those surrounding him were product their times and that the teachings were oral for long time before they were written stated taught how alleviate suffering and nothing more although that enough offer sincere thanks every day since then many peoples have elaborated mythology beside buddhism that suits their natures and culture you don have believe magic realize the truth the path benefit from the results sincere practice suffering and the pursuit alleviate universal truth mark epstein thoughts without thinker helps put much the mythology perspective for and helped realize that was hungry ghost hell own suffering until could come terms with past not implying that know more about reality than anyone self too grounded logic and practicality though and find hard believe what can prove personally needed framework pursue buddhism without magical thinking the best advice from the teacher our temple for was take what works for you your path leave what doesn thank you for your post ,1

thank you much for sharing this with rather new buddhism and haven’ quite gotten into these topics yet the temple currently attend have one question however that hope someone can answer our karma current conditions are based lifetimes merit then how are the chances being reborn human again extremely small this karma counting other kinds life forms may have lived apologize the answer obvious what not thanks advance ,-1

thank you for this nice post just couple comments buddha not god sakyamuni buddha was man who through his own effort and accumulated merit was able rid himself his attachments and misconceptions probably add something here that the result this ridding was that wasn his own admission just man anymore according buddha taught how alleviate suffering nothing more that this not really true has been explained for example bhikkhu bodhi recently think just minor nitpick this case though all all what would personally add this perhaps after the bit about sutras the necessity learning from those who have walked and studied the path much more than did seems like people either think they can just rely authority figure and that they don need the foundations they can rely only text and don need contact with people favorite they don need either ,1

many these points resonate with the ones that don are and even these teachings are true why are they taught seems that personally must have experience that verifies the existence other realms rebirth don understand the value having intellectual understanding these teachings someone tells valuable earn wholesome living sit meditation these intellectual concepts can put the test and can thereby move from intellectual understanding deeper felt understanding don understand how can test the idea rebirth seems that will just have continue practice and have experience that affirms this idea ,1
very well put going you about copy the book ,1
something ’ always struggled with since getting into this practice the human incarnation and the idea rebirth understand that this human form all have extremely rare and quite gift have heard the story the turtle spoken temple before far ’ aware humans are the only ones that can hear and understand the dharma this alone makes the human incarnation extraordinary after die the chances being blessed with another human incarnation anytime cycle soon unfathomable yet tibetan buddhism lama can not only incarnate human after death but also the same gender and within the same region the globe they’ not buddha they would not take form any living creature earth after death far know ’ aware that their knowledge the dharma unimaginably vast compared most but still confusing have yet read the tibetan book the dead which might give some insight into why this other schools buddhism believe this extraordinary method rebirth this just tibetan thing ,1

great job mellowde writing this post help folks understand something that can difficult times grasp this not misconception but one important point that would emphasize people who might curious and who are more familiar with western abrahamic religions that fundamental implication buddhism that every being the buddha consciousness the difference lays whether human being recognizes this truth not one doesn have become buddhist recognize this but meditation and self reflection does help great deal developing mindfulness understanding reality and becoming more present life more than likely one will also come directly experience this state oneness with the buddha consciousness with all beings one practices the teachings whatever label choose put ourselves whether buddhist christian muslim hindu jewish taoist atheist agnostic meatbag human developing our wisdom and compassion will come perceive the world differently and will behave differently will think speak act and build habits accord with our understanding reality and accord with the love that inherently within the buddha consciousness will not become perfect beings and will likely not completely discard all self interest but will become more loving and compassionate towards each other make the choice digressing now but darwinian evolution can only taking living beings far after reaches point equilibrium between self interest and compassion and conscious being develops choice then the next step requires evolution consciousness which each being with the precious gift choice must choose undergo their own will order experience true bliss equanimity and unconditional love sidenote the experience oneness with all things the universe not just new age woo woo made concept there are neuro physiological explanations for why experience perception self oriented individuated consciousness opposed universal consciousness which believe the default state consciousness many you may have already seen jill bolte taylor famous ted talk stroke insight her story gives some insight into how our two brain hemisphere see reality differently theory that meditation allows gradually dissolve some these mechanisms which filter reality and create this illusory perception individuated self the self experience our normal waking state ,1
seems like constitution that has unless feel like taking away clause not worth the paper written ,-1
india does not have absolute free speech and isn new india first jailed poet sultanpuri the poet who braved jail for insulting nehru for year because wrote poem criticizing him every government has been suppressing free speech since then some more than others this stems from the first amendment india constitution which put very broad category exceptions free speech nothing sub clause clause shall affect the operation any existing law prevent the state from making any law far such law imposes reasonable restrictions the exercise the right conferred the said sub clause the interests the sovereignty and integrity india the security the state friendly relations with foreign states public order decency morality relation contempt cour defamation incitement offence all the stuff bold are the exceptions where laws can made hinder free speech you can imagine very broad ,1
please watch some raga recent interviews odisha interview opinion much more mature leader than modi speaks lot about taking everyone opinions into account talking with people disagrees with understand their perspective etc the things says make lot more sense and agree with them more than what hearing modi speaches also allows unscripted questions and even answers tough ones that are basically veiled insults your family hasn been able anything good for the nation why this amount freedom speech good and makes for much better discourse the congress today also announced that they floating the idea ubi universal basic income around which seems very cool india should the forefront innovative poverty reduction schemes since our country has such high population under the poverty line the world should learning from and testing out ubi would amazing for that here link video about what ubi course there lot reasons why should vote against modi but these were few reasons for why should vote for gandhi ,1

another huge misconception thinking that the buddha taught that there self this course mistranslation misinterpretation anattā the pāli word for self natthattā the suttas illustrate the buddha specifically put these questions self identification aside rather demonstrated how anattā was actually supposed gradually used end clinging all things hence the quote sabbe dhammā anattā dhp 279 ṭhānissaro bhikkhu explains this misconception ,1

simple take religion out bjp politics people may actually give them chance one always votes for the lesser evil and right now congress and group allies looks like the only alternative bjp has created environment the country where anyone who isn with them their viewpoint against them they don have franchise tell anyone for that matter whom pray what eat whose hands hold and whatnot they don want they most welcome practice that don impose others and you can just ignore demon gst and the countless attacks various institutions our country ,1
currently have power centers modi shah and gandhis not good when power centers take voters for granted resulting corruption upa unilateral decisions demonitsation and taking control normally independent institutions this has happened both during congress and bjp times alternating power keeps both centers their toes the end not about who better but country making sure politicians don get complacent ,1
 matter what bjp aayegi because modi good orator get that didnt shit yrs but stuff like swaach bharat abhiyaan and make india were huge rahul cant pull something like this need have unique personality that and modi has one even though shit people will bring him again but this time there will huge shift are seeing other states too where the popularity bjp has gone down loottt don decide which party vote based these comments use the neta app see who contesting your area and what his rating ,1
goddammit you guys not vote for any party just vote for the best local candidate please not subvert representative democracy like this don vote nota because has power just vote for local parties independents you find the leading party candidates corrupt don vote for known corrupt criminal people anyone else you vote for better than known corrupt criminal person really simple ,-1

hey dude really enjoyed your post and because the last couple years been interested western religion think this might the right time pick buddhism doesn bother you too much really apreciate you could send pdf what the buddha taught thanks lot gheorghita5570,1
 was watching video from the pretty interesting religion for breakfast youtube channel talked about the prevalence true scotsman arguments discussing religion buddhists are nonviolent well here this example buddhist who did this that violent thing well they weren true buddhist hadn thought about before but lot discussion about religion goes this way there really are many variations buddhist practice and belief think the differences are greater from one end the other than the differences christianity and islam don know whole lot about but gather there great deal variety hinduism well ,1
regarding karma appears that many people the west assume that karma cause and effect automatically means predictability cause and effect reminds scientific experiments where one effect follows the same cause during lots repeated experiments which why can predict the outcome certain causes with human actions quite different for one cannot easily repeat the same experiment with precise setting hundreds times but more importantly effects range from immediate and obvious deferred and very subtle personal solution try aware that words and actions have consequences not all which might able predict but useful try and act with best intentions that will increase the likelihood good outcomes ,1

 buddha not god correct buddha was not god buddha was superior the gods ,1
this was such amazing breakdown found buddhism later life and now stuggle catch and understand this was great breakdown easy terms the basic concepts thank you ,1
yes ’ recommended time one’ cadence their breath some traditions ,0
your incorrect buddha god was human before enlightenment yes but buddhas are divine figures who are worshiped the idea that they aren gods comes heavily from the fact that that the first major world religions summit the people chosen speak for buddhism were desperate make seem like modernist religion that was compatible with modern world views rather than old superstitious ones they tried translating way that seemed secular rather than mystical wasn really controversial call buddhas gods before this modernist interpretation spread and caught your issue semantics the terms rebirth and reincarnation aren objectively delineated this way english you can say that more meaningful translation would rebirth but translating reincarnation isn really strictly speaking wrong ,1

 agroo,0
definitely fact there are least couple ways you could one way would coordinate each recitation with one breath then you using mala you would move forward one bead another way way that prefer fact coordinate one breath with recitations ymmv but for this usually means recitations the breath and recitations the out breath after one breath you move one bead forward this takes significantly longer one mala but the time you are done you have done 1000 recitations there are also many other things you can combine recitation with prostrations visualization listening the sound the recitation itself contemplation koan like who who now recites the buddha name and walking meditation fact you could even combine walking breathing and recitation the nembutsu very flexible practice experiment with and see what works for you ,1

great post have somewhat different interpretation karma that struggle with because feel straightforward and true where everything have read complicated and unclear curious what folks here think experience has been that inner conflict and even doubt interferes with expression our thoughts and feelings the universe you ever have those times flow where your inner experience completely reflected the apparent “external” experience this seems times high coherence conflict and doubt will interfere how often you see somebody who you would think gosh how are they getting away with that would say they have conflict about maybe sounds like bit stretch but simple best can figure this compatible with what can make sense the concept buddhist karma and reduces very simple concept that may well not even concept simply you get out what you put careful and measured with what you put doesn’ depend any notion good bad right wrong but are not typically aware what’ lurking our not conscious and the effect practice make that more conscious and when are more aware can avoid doing things with conflict and doubt seems fit the model the path leading you “escape” karma but will not claim academic expert this just what have perceived own life and observing others trying reduce things much possible there nothing “believe ” seems more practical find something simple enough experience directly ,1

when entered this hobbie went the store and the first thing that the seller told actually that even more all the people asked for advice told that maybe not unpopular after all sorry for english not native speaker ,1
get phone and you have your dac amp combo that good enough even for sennheiser hd800s ,1
 bought first tube amp and was able tell difference with the same pair headphones had for years they make iems sound better idk man think you already have few pairs headphones getting good amp can long way,1
classic circlejerk post,1
 unpopular opinion what literally everyone says this sub,0
 mostly happy with purplehearts running the dac although would like more power get the bass want without distorting the rest two things would like try out planar and tubes whatever can get more warmth and whump ,1
 with any technology upgrade the bottleneck first your computer has worse processor than your graphics card upgrading your graphics card won shit likewise for audio equipment you have shit headphones nothing will help them sound better ,1
 bought dragon fly red use with the feed with flac files can’ hear difference when use the iphone adapter and spotify premium ,1
the only argument against this the headphone already matches your sound preferences the splurging dac and amp aren big deal that point for years was content headphone and wouldn splurging for the rest equipment ,1
 and people really really need and want amps and dacs for their cheaper headphones then getting modi dac with jds atom amp for that will easily hold you off until you’ ready upgrade your gear mean don even like this mentality gets you audibly transparent dac and amp there realistically reason upgrade unless you after certain features ,1
this isn unpopular this mandatory ,0
 bought the tin audio and spend any money other parts setup will long time from now want fully appreciate the difference that has already made even with standard smartphone dacs carry pixel the moment scared risking the possibility that there only much differentiation able notice want really enjoy the nuances this small investment have already unlocked edit guess updated source material too far favoring flac for good chunk collection that definitely important link the chain ,1
 dac amp sexier looking than headphones though obviously that why costs more ,1
 wait that guy ,0
 use rme adi dac with tin t2s come bro think part the reason because lot people this forum are also tech junkies love toys and just happens align somewhat with liking music one reaaalllyyy needs smartphones when the ones from even generations ago are just fine today but people want them anyway ,1
 would agree however you are not tight budget there are some mid headphones that benefit from better amp thinking specifically the hd650 and otl tube amps the diminishing returns for dac are much worse than amps since you won able hear the difference anyway you are this for the long haul here recommendation don spend more than dac partial the topping d50 you won able hear difference don buy bunch mid garbage consolidate and buy true end game headphone whatever that means for you like zmf great with tubes start with entry level amp like the jds labs atom when you can afford and you desire get better amp tube good match for your endgame headphone just know that the tube amp game bottomless money hole you that route again don buy bunch middle the road stuff straight the best you save more money since you will probably end there anyway you are like and have self control did mention like tubes tubes ,1
very unpopular opinion ,1
 dac amp the idsd however due its features iematch bass analog sound processing usb power output that makes act battery bank could see people getting use with less expensive headphones the asp some voodoo phase shifting that doesn affect the and works many cases widen the soundstage with perceived degradation ,-1
how could you say something controversial yet brave ,1
 don see how this unpopular opinion you see this same advice from the few who actually try help headphoneadvice ,-1
they should make new tag called hot takes ,1
 agree but thx 789 looks pretty driving ear pods all seriousness people should just buy atom with whatever dac has the features that they want and they can have the best both worlds that being said bought 789 better drive k7xx and they but did not expect make dent the sen veil the hd6xx and did much that beigjng think that the amp xonar stx not operating spec think that the atom being fed decent 98db thd dac and any the mid headphones sweet spot that years ago could only had buying benchmark dac for lot more than ,1
 similar note see lot posts here where people buy gear then stream 320mbps spotify over honestly see more difference with uncompressed music cds flacs tidal deezer’ top tier over cheap hardware than compressed stuff over incredible hardware find baffling how people skimp the source was revelation going back uncompressed after 15years mp3s ,1
 usually tend spend about half what spent headphones the amp works pretty well ,-1
 disagree once bought decent dac plus powerful and transparent amp can run any headphones want without having upgrade ,1
people don seem realize that 1000 dollar dac isn any different from 200 dollar dac same goes for almost every solid state amp ,0

hell using audio dac with pair 58x and can deafening listening levels with zero distortion always tempted buy jds atom and grace design sdac but should probably just satisfied with what have already least until upgrade headphones ,1
totally agree that headphones should the first upgrade point but have admit than when listening music from digital source even with cheap earbuds like have external amp just for the analogue feel volume control pot ,1
 whole heartily agree main setup audeze lcd mx4 and massdrop sdac may get something like mass drop thx aaa some day but think the differences will barely audible and could probably only tell abx testing ,1
this the standard opinion ,0
\ the best way increase your listening experience first upgrade your headphones then amplifiers and then finally dacs this completely standard opinion ,1
totally makes sense would also add upgrading music file quality the argument make sure you streaming least 320 kbps flac ,1
 unpopular opinion one the most commonly stated things about upgrading gear ask nearly anyone this sub and they will tell you upgrade headphones first ,1
 really happy with emotiva 100 amp and fiio d03k dac connected chromecast audio planning stick with these components for long time probably get better headphones the near future currently using beyerdynamics 770 love the beyers though and can imagine other headphones sounding better but know there definitely better stuff out there ,1
bjp insecurity showing ,0
had hd6xx for year before getting dac and amp really had crank volume use them before the dac and amp massdrop sdac and have windows amp gain button most audio sources well works great most say the 6xx don work well for gaming but like them bit better than hd558 ,1
 think this also depends the headphones totally case use easy drive cans and the difference between iphone’ included lightning and the oppo recently bought are limited slightly tighter bass slightly wider soundstage tiny bit more separation and bit more directionality with specific sounds such marbles hitting the ground “bubbles” yosi horikawa you can hear them drop certain direction more than with the 5mm lightning but feel like not carrying the oppo stupid dragonfly black with cck the 5mm lightning adapter does very good job and music still enjoyable unless close eyes and quier place can start nitpicking headphones make such bigger difference than amp dac device now imagine that were using cans that are way harder drive the lightning adapter even the dragonfly would show more difference but for cans with sub 40ohm resistance those devices are not critical unless you really are thinkung about some power hungry stuff you should first upgrade your cans and then get amp that can properly feed them ,1
absolutely balls deep the middle claiming incredibly popular opinion and standard peice advice across the entire spectrum audio nerds and headfi enthusiasts unpopular and you somehow unique for having right not down voting for such shitty title game ,1
with attention and devotion the meaning behind the word pronunciation prefer amituofo ,-1
arre vah uppar lungi state mein hain must need some guts lol ,1
that not unpopular opinion ´ just fact the headphones will have the biggest impact sound quality and good amp will amplify the sound without distorting also use ,1
whatever suits you amituofo chinese transliteration amitabha buddha omituofo regional dialect pronunciation amituofo amitabha sanskrit name amitabha buddha amitayus another sanskrit name amitabha buddha you may included the word buddha when you chant this name amitabha buddha amitabha buddha simply just say amitabha amitabha the chinese pronunciation ends with which means buddha itself amituofo includes the word buddha with already koreans say differently japanese any these ways are fine ,1
according the buddha chant namo amitabha buddha namo amitayus buddha whichever suits you ,0
stunning and brave wow controversial,1
 each his own,1
the funny part about this the same truism for channel room audio spend most your budget the speakers this isn rocket surgery here get the most bang buck think the problem most people buy the headphones first with what they have then they have more money they don want upgrade the headphones they have they want add new gear because everyone likes adding new gear rather than replacing sell your old headphones give them friend and get something better first you follow the rules use for speakers with headphones your budget should about 3rd speakers and about 3rd preamp amp source device etc yes for everything else ,1
namo amida budsu ,0
this right ’ like people who buy reverb plugins but use condensers,1
 entry level combo unit does okay job powering headphones after getting the 6xx and hearing that they scale well with better amp dac splurged for the 789 the atom dac would have been plenty upgrade but wanted more versatility and didn want amp dac being the thing holding back the next upgrade stage can imagine that will beyond elears lcd2 but time will tell atom dac didn seem like the huge leap upgrade over the current combo unit using well the atom would but going balanced with the smsl thx pairing gives more peace mind \ \ forgot where was going with this went straight those high end cans with the monoprice combo unit seems like bottleneck even going far saying just plug into mobo for awhile then upgrade from there would disservice while mostly agree with your stated sentiment there are upgrade plateaus same with any hobby really the atom 789 didn exist then yeah probably still plug elears into entry level unit ,1

buddhism doesn care much about how this particular planet even this particular universe came the buddha did talk about some kind evolutionarily mechanism for humans once but that wasn for the sake giving precise answer such question anyway most buddhists familiar with the concept evolution and who know that science accept but doesn occupy big place their minds just like how for most other humans ,1
truputi ramoną stilius neša hmmm ,0
amitābha the buddha did not discuss evolution however did teach that all phenomena are dependent nature not surprising that the evolution our species dependent the existence previously existing species and and forth the bottom line how does evolution the knowledge aid you your path nirvana doesn’ why spend time thinking ,-1
 agree with this because pretty sure people who haven cross referenced lots headphones will able discern differences between dacs and amps which much more subtle difference ,1

start with daily breath meditation lots basics marks existence ’ okay you have understanding any this start the teachings buddha largely build themselves many the teachings are interrelated take one thing time and open your awareness the most very basic teachings the most basic principle buddhism one skillful unskillful actions part your practice works for you then continue tool teaching causing your brain the point you lose the ability focus your breath meditation then let for right now you have the choice every present moment cultivate good intention even choose watch your breath this place strength for all the negative things accept what you cannot change accept that all negative things will pass everything changes everything ,1
sādhu namo amitābha there are quite few books the subject think ‘what the buddha taught’ walpola always good primer lot’ good videos youtube recommend master shengyan the dharma drum series are great later when you’ start read sūtras you can check out the translations the ‘buddhist text translation society’ there’ great documentary narrated richard gere which gives good non sectarian summarization the buddha’ life best wishes all namo amitābha ,1
 also beginner serious buddhism but not meditation and would recommend that you definitely take serious practice one the benefits besides being able see your own and others patterns behavior more clearly and giving you space make better decisions that really developed compassion far listened jack kornfield buddhism for beginners audible which really touching and excellent and plan read thich nhat hanh the heart the buddha teaching which about the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path think those are going make excellent starting point sure more experienced and well read people will have great suggestions too ,1

 understand what you mean here and sure that the common people pakistan themselves suffer from terrorism but very difficult believe that the govt military has role the attack the past they categorically denied the fact that india did fact conduct surgical strikes the indian govt had proof and the pakistan govt military still weren ready believe that they had terrorist training centres and launch pads their country when you say that actually getting involved the attack might harm pakistan status quo find difficult believe almost every time they used these methods smoke screens very well turn out same case this time too just have wait until the reports come and prove which one correct ,-1
first all thank you for taking this initiative think most indians don consider ordinary pakistani citizens evil intentioned are angry your governments and the military isi establishment with that said alternative warfare facepalm recent times the government has been trying its best resume dialogue with india there the kartarpur corridor that the government really trying push hard every single time there possibility improved relations between the two countries terror attack immediately takes place probably much older you and have been seeing this pattern for long time allow present perspective pakistani you know how your military dominates the nation often said that other countries have army but pakistan the army has country the military very influential civilian government can afford against its wishes not only that the military controls pakistan foreign relations particular its policy towards india top that the military has business interests every sector your economy why does have much power because seen critical for pakistan survival seen the only thing standing between pakistan and its evil neighbour india our countries achieved lasting peace the importance pakistan military would decrease since pakistanis won consider themselves under constant threat they would question the need have such outsized and influential army budgets would reduced privileges might curtailed for the military this would loss its power and influence and that certainly won the army and the isi control the militant groups you admitted much your alternate warfare comment any time they want terror attack take place they can issue the orders and this that happens every time peace has chance the pakistani military establishment orders terror attack nip the bud 423 this evil and cynical not only that hypocritical pakistan claims represent pre 1947 india muslims frequently raises concerns about real and imaginary troubles indian muslims but carrying out terror attacks like this has only been strengthening the hands radical right wing hindutva groups pakistan has given them paintbrushes paint all muslims terrorist sympathizers has given them ammo attack liberals and centrists soft terror any indian who tries say anything positive about pakistan such considering pakistan view point labelled anti india anti national etc you are making things extremely hard for peace loving indians and extremely easy for right wing hawks trolls and goons and finally this also short sighted the age 24x7 news channels and social media outrage easy create and sustain search eyeballs and advertising revenue the channel hosts try outdo each other sensationalism and emotional hooks the result that our citizens get whipped into frenzy every time there terror attack eventually one day when there even bigger terror attack imagine 1000 dead the hysteria will much that the government would forced take military action when that happens surgical strike can escalate into war you know india has superiority conventional forces what would happen pakistan starts lose your military has already been humiliated once 1971 and another loss would completely unacceptable them they would likely use nukes against india that could easily escalate into nuclear holocaust south asia where india would severely damaged but pakistan would completely wiped out 128 ,1
pakistan ideology not parallel nation this thing kashmir old civil war going pakistan really not separate nation the end the day indians not detest pakistanis people born the territory today known pakistan but pakistan the anti india your sorrows and sympathies with indians because deep down you probably not peace with pakistan the ideology itself india needs dismember the terrorist state pakistan for peace south asia and the world pakistan was basically puppet state hoisted departing anglo american world order keep south asia under the thumb india can peace with independent republics sindh west punjab even kashmir and have usa canada style relations with each the nations but not with pakistan understand though you are coming from place love the end the day you can only speak for yourself and not all pakistanis and definitely not for pakistan individual individual thank you ,1

 posted some parts comments below the original thread and was downvoted hell because people were angry but let explain how not only pakistan but you average pakistani responsible too first off you are right that the pakistani government may not gain much out this particular terror attack your country the fatf greylist for failing curb terror financing this attack going used against you when comes the decision blacklisting pakistan but let talk about the the pakistani economy and the army the economy crumbling and imran khan doing good job trying resuscitate parts includes getting more austere far expenses are concerned imran khan came off the support the army and has far not touched their budget but what happens and when things dire further the army does not want that plus the election season india and rahul gandhi mayawati not the same kind demon that pakistanis can see modi the army needs modi back and whoever financed this attack well knows that this one going get people more nationalistic here and vote for the bjp this helps your army drum more fear and ensure that matter how shit the economy turns out their budget untouched even raised further now coming the topic this attack the attacker was local mason doubt about that unlike pakistan did with kasab india hasn failed acknowledge his citizenship but 350 kilogram explosives costs money tons where does poor mason get this money come from has pledged allegiance pakistan based jem jem banned where they get money finance such expensive terror attack organization like jem would given chance blow indian cities all day but given that they chose this particular time execute attack you should consider who chooses benefit from this mentioned above your army the tax you pay honest citizen goes your defence budget and part this makes way through the explosives that were used for this terror attack ,1

look anyone with half brain will not blame the average pakistani citizen but your country straight cultivated the terror groups way warfare post 1971 where was understood that conventional warfare will not possible dent hole into india your politicians your military has cultivated this atmosphere and ultimately the same groups have grown out control and have targeted your citizens masood azhar being banned means nothing when you know that isi going cultivate him and his ilk for unconventional warfare ,-1

 won deny that pakistan hasn been involved alternative warfare before 10th the size india with largely inferior defense machinery our forces probably deemed the only way keeping the indian advances check you truly not support terrorism suggest you avoid using terms like alternate warfare and justifying when your country doing just makes your entire post sound like load crap ,-1
\ askindia\ this particular terror attack seems have affected the psyches many ordinary citizens far more than others for example just now some association local senior citizens took procession around our roads condemning pakistan shouting bmkj vande mataram etc local called news channels bangalore are milking this attack the hilt the whole day hard hitting visuals combined with sentimental songs like mere watan logo and other patriotic kannada songs playing the background lot discussions about war and revenge and course tonnes ads between many traumatized discussions here reddit this sub and others what can need some answers now etc did not see this level nationwide trauma protests processions during 2008 when number deaths were far higher and far closer the ordinary citizen than this attack more recent years did not see such protests after the uri attack 2016 army casualties the sukma naxal ied attack 2017 crpf casualties question simple why you think has this particular terror attack affected our society this much ,1

war mongering the easiest way out following horrific attack the kind which happened pulwama yesterday gives immense satisfaction the innate bloodlust that present different amounts all humans makes you look more righteous and more patriotic compared the many you want paint anti national let kill four thousand pakistanis said goswami the ones talking peace should slapped and paraded donkey said the dangerously deranged kangana ranaut let war said every third person social media yet none them would stop and think for moment that again these underpaid soldiers who would have put their lives the line actually has happen all that even assume that just beasts the other side war mongering lets you put nice cloak over all that should thinking about this hour once you whip that frenzy some channels and pages are effectively doing the job easy questions will asked why the intelligence warnings were not heeded why proper armoured vehicles were not provided why the route they took was not checked and sanitised why the crpf jawans are grossly underpaid when have enough money spare for fighter jet deal several times the earlier cost why the conflict kashmir was stepped after the relative calm that existed 2014 what has taken over the minds the most educated minds kashmir for them take arms what has led them how did state which witnessed high polling percentages just five years back turn into one where elections are virtually impossible where only less than are turning when has happened some pockets who freed jaish mohammed commander maulana mazood azar who was lodged indian jail why have there been massive increase terror attacks under government which came power promising put end all and which claimed that has successfully crushed terrorism through demonetisation rahul gandhi press conference today which said that this should not politicised might look graceful but not talking about all really not the solution these political questions need asked not blame someone but ensure that such gruesome murders are put end yet all these questions are now buried the war mongering and the attacks imaginary tukde tukde gang unleashed the sangh media and social media ecosystem fake news being spread from photoshopped image rahul gandhi sitting along with one the attackers one how the cpi kerala mouthpiece deshabhimani did not print the news the attack did prominently the front page need ask who are these people who are busy spreading fake news this hour creating hate against particular sections and creating divisions when there shouldn none need ask what their agenda and who stands gain from this need ask why they are diverting from the questions that need asked and creating imaginary enemies the answer there the face the ones who spoke campaign rally today war mongering solves nothing only gives you impression solution • praveen srp ,1

 important remember that the pakistan and the army operate separately and history very good indicator that this means that often times there collision interest between the two sides but the end the day the military establishment has always had the more power and the final say things this explains why jem banned pakistan but not eradicated also explains why good relationship with neighboring countries always suggested hinted pakistan but never materialized would also like add that the oppressed minorities pakistan are aware the army problem and are just sick and tired anyone else but their voices are suppressed ,1
much appreciated ,1
 all have die today tomorrow only the most valiant people get the chance sacrifice their lives for india yes miss them and are sad but aren afraid they killed our soldiers scare into giving kashmir india place billion people they can kill all they can scare all dont give into their scare tactics giving kashmir pakistan not solution soldier job protect the country and even their deaths they protected our civilians our army doing its job very well ,-1

thank you and welcome that lot great information for our site here much appreciation bit much digest all once just pick through here and there for starters nichiren states “…bodhisattva superior practices will certainly appear and establish the object devotion the first 500 years the latter day the law” the latter day the law started 1500 nichiren couldn have been who though was because miscalculated such are the dangers bad math nichiren lived about 200 years before the beginning the latter day the law which means that nichiren was wrong about everything fact nichiren acknowledged much the end his life hut seven feet height but the snow outside piled depth ten feet surrounded four walls ice and icicles hang down from the eaves like necklace jewels adorning place religious practice while inside hut snow heaped place rice far from attaining buddhahood this present life like the cold suffering bird longer shave head look like quail and robe gets stiff with ice that resembles the icy wings the mandarin duck such place where friends from former times never come visit where have been abandoned even own disciples you have sent these vessels empty dishes which heap with snow imagining rice and from which drink water thinking gruel nichiren some buddha ,1

 think going get downvoted this but hear out anyway only thinking out loud don think have enough leverage over pakistan make them reconsider their strategy funding terror groups thinking what happened because then effectively used aided the mukti bahini counter pakistan certainly has well oiled machinery going for itself kashmir that they been actively using against and until have something similar that could use against them don see how could negate their strategy don blame just the current dispensation for not having leverage over pakistan not sure what people make comments but for cmv discussion with anyone who might interested just teenager feeling way around geopolitics ,1
why everyone saying that india should war with pakistan not that simple sounds there are lot diplomatic issues involved even war declared not without bloodshed both the sides pakistan has large enough army give good fight they decide fight back that india victory not guaranteed and stop with the bulls like russia will support india china will support pakistan this not some classroom fight with countries choosing the sides which they want even the war breaks out will trigger domino effect and will eventually lead ww3 stop speculating start thinking logical sense war not the answer instead diplomatic war would best bet weaken pakistan try sanction them cut off their supply lines thank you for reading expecting lot downvotes just putting voice out ,1

 just shut and follow ikeda “that the way practice correctly” shintaro ishihara diet member grandson died truly would have been alright hadn but buddhist punishment for slandering ishihara thought was fool despised and tried make fool anyone who meets gains fortune anyone who betrays antagonizes will fall into hell this the severe law buddhism remember that well all ikeda own words nichiren’ “standard proof” “doesn’ apply daisaku” “ the sensei” leader permitted acquire following his own for would divisive incursion into president ikeda prerogatives supreme leader source forget about raising successors and the next generation ends with ikeda whatever and the say and print are true “that mindset must cease” this something that work toward here the ikeda worship which ikeda himself promotes truly disgusting gotten infinitely worse since the nichiren shoshu priesthood excommunicated ikeda and removed his dumb cult from their list approved lay organizations take look daisaku ikeda the world’ foremost authority nichiren buddhism source that what found over one the sgi many vanity presses paid for the sgi members donations which exists only publish things written others that daisaku ikeda name rubber stamped can pretend author all the cult leaders self publish via their own culty little vanity presses why should daisaku ikeda considered the world foremost authority nichiren buddhism never completed any formal course study never been tonsured has credentials whatsoever even people the real world don consider him legitimate scholar examination soka education necessitates reiterating its virtual unfamiliarity academic and educational circles outside japan therefore any critical analysis soka comes with the proviso that great deal what has been written about this approach its principal proponents currently inaccessible for broad based study the chief reasons for this are twofold firstly neither makiguchi toda nor ikeda are regarded scholars any traditional sense they were not university educated formally trained academics and therefore their essentially makiguchi’ and toda’ publications were largely relegated relative obscurity japanese educational spheres source 2016 1138575 credentials matter outside cult leader little cult personality there are plenty priests nichiren priests who have been studying everything nichiren and lotus sutra since their teens who have devoted their entire careers and lifetimes the study these teachings while daisaku ikeda has instead chosen jet setting lifestyle paying various people meet with him sit for photo that will then played like was some big deal daisaku ikeda has never shakubukued single person even apparently simply being the top authoritarian the soka gakkai organizations makes him default the world foremost authority the three top theoreticians the gakkai the supreme theoretician course president ikeda followed probably kodaira yoshihei toda convert member parliament general administrator and the head the study department supreme theoretician simply the prerogative the topmost authoritarian the dictatorship pyramid sure sounds like that the award you win for seizing the presidency hmm little could anyone have ever imagined that when ikeda was born would mentor leader peace activist and truly one the greatest humans that has ever lived source one the greatest humans that has ever lived wowzers who said humility and modesty had any place within true buddhism remember ikeda permitting this sort grotesque hero worship not outright designing everyone sgi should embarrassed this naked preening and self glorification why should ikeda considered the supreme theoretician anyone can say that where the actual proof where the evidence that ikeda does fact possess the requisite qualifications where are ikeda credentials what legitimate study program has ikeda completed dropped out community college his very first semester ikeda has nothing and yet the sgi members are supposed believe that this greedy grasping little man who has only ever sought power and wealth somehow more knowledgeable than the priests who devoted themselves study and practice for entire careers and even lifetimes obscene scandal this not buddhism this one hopelessly insecure little man quest for immortality ikeda bound for oblivion just surely any other person who has ever existed eternity will not remember his name anyone source and what about actual proof ikeda favorite son died age stomach ailment that rarely fatal for all his efforts ikeda has failed awarded the nobel peace prize all ikeda jibbajabba about making the impossible possible sure looks like empty words doesn ikeda can make work when has the luxury devoting every moment every day what chance you have making work and what about world peace than when toda recreated the soka gakkai after wwii things have been getting better anywhere the world thanks the ikeda cult ikeda and his dumb cult are useless all this worship daisaku ikeda isn doing anyone bit good except for daisaku ikeda course how demeaning being nothing more than chorus member sing the praises one self important little swine man that all the sgi members exist for what about ikeda life worth emulating has friends hasn been able shakubuku single person everybody japan hates him doesn even have any grandchildren his own family completely broken ikeda nothing but vampire who thinks can suck away everyone else life force and money and thus live forever ,1

 have probably watched dozens hours worth combat footage from the last nearly two decades war afghanistan syria and iraq and don’ recall ever reading about these many casualties single strike can’ help but feel bit skepticism that eliminated many 300 terrorists one blow when don’ recall air strike against qaeda daesh isil yielding such high casualties one swift operation see bunch hysteria social media already and people are celebrating this like champions league final far can tell they knew exactly what they were doing throwing out that 200 300 number,1

few dots could connect far multi hundred body count after the pulwama attack pakistan must had anticipated another attack terrorist launch pads pok near loc therefore they emptied those launch pads and took all terrorists camp inside pakistan they must though that india which wary entering pok airspace would enter pakistani airspace too bad for them that india did the unthinkable after they assembled all them one camp also people are forgetting that there were jets and three attack locations comes around jets per attack location and each jet can carry couple thousand kilograms ordnance burnt patches land the mirages flew from gwalior carrying full battle load 1000 kms away assuming that they flew straight line they must carried fuel tanks with them now don know they jettisoned them before after delivering the bomb payload and pretty obvious that those small burnt patches vegetation were not result massive bombs because they would created proper craters pakistan interests that they deny this attack for multiple reasons some them are jets flew into your territory bombed the shit out you and flew back unscathed rather than admit that you failed you can simply say such attacks happened they admit that attacks did happen then would equal admitting that there was jem camp there which would startling news for lot pakistani citizens and they would lose face internationally especially when they are seeking bailouts from imf they admit being attacked pakistani soil then their citizens would pressurize them retaliate and against whom will they retaliate and how against indian forces and through regular actors that could result their ass handed them further escalation via terrorists pakistan would admit that they sent terrorists india attack that confession like never seen before and lastly shame indian citizens who trust pakistan word more than your own government ,-1
tbh feel government india should release some satellite picture before and after the attack for proof the public because this feels like stunt before the election ppl that say they dropped 1000kg worth bombs hence terrorist must there have keep mind that those 1000kg bombs were spread out and had large area impact they were free falling from large height the matter fact such action whether right wrong can very devastating for everyone not done acc last viable option ,1

 think the narrative has gotten twisted lot here due some smart pakistani action first all this the first time the iaf has been used respond provocation the pakistani army against india even 1999 kargil the iaf din cross the and this time they crossed not just the but the international border itself pakistan however doesn want escalate the conflict yet also needs save face therefore they smartly controlled the narrative twisting the argument from india violating their sovereignity the efficacy the action now the argument came down whether 200 300 terrorists were killed rather than the fact that india has raised the cost for pakistani army support terrorists immeasurably earlier pakistan could use nuclear shield train and launch terrorists with impunity whereas now india has shown pakistan that they can infiltrate deep they need within pakistan destroy the terrorists iaf easily went till dropped payload and then waltzed back out without suffering single scratch they did this when the pakistani army and air force were ostensibly high alert and they attacked from the theater pakistan was preparing defend this shows that their nothing pakistan can stop any such incursions the future too besides behave themselves ultimately even killed 200 terrorists wouldn matter usa has been droning pakistanis for ages and still losing afghanistan the message that india has sent pakistan much more important than the number terrorists killed not that all debating whether the mission would succeed with 200 deaths 300 deaths just some smart psychology the pakistanis the fact the mission has already succeeded ,1
this entire affair just cynical electioneering from both sides the isi wants the bjp win good for pakistan more precisely put the pakistani establishment hindutva rises makes the looming economic recession pakistan easier bear you can fall back saber rattling distract the people you need someone willing baited easily and the bjp more than willing dance along the bjp have their own problems with employment creation which they manifestly failed with they are more than happy tag along this escalating nonsense even the domestic economy remains disappointing ,1

 take air strike all you are fighting whether the bombs struck terrorists not whether 200 300 arbitrary number etc but what you fail understand how meticulously india changed the whole game you look pakistani reaction they are all charged how iaf could breach their airspace they now want pak airforce army retaliate now paf have terror camps strike india and they strike civilian army location they are responsible for escalation and needles say they something stupid india gonna rip them apart and there nothing could about edit feb fuckers have balls gotta give them ,-1
must also appreciate diplomatic angle played govt the only official statement about this attack came from ministry external affairs mea and not ministry defense pmo any other military unit and that too with subtle definition these strikes non military preemptive strikes which mean that strikes were not meant against any civil military targets pakistan but against globally recognized terrorist organisation and these strikes were self defense and not any retaliation this cunning statement pretty much check mates pakistan and bring legitimacy and global support for our actions now unless pakistan can find non military non civil target which could harm them pakistan cannot legitimately retaliate ,-1

great job iaf ,1
 cents the bombing iaf there were planes and thousands pounds bombs dropped balakot surely have some videos pictures those areas from the general public pakistan shit like this can hidden would have been first the mic had actually done something like this why are every sources ours still mumbling over this while ispr has given clear version why didn the paf shoot the aircraft down miles nothing airwarfare shoot down retreating jet and the debris will farther than miles and into our own territory giving rise claims the offender that they were their own territory but still they have 10km buffer zone place should tracking well within their border this just for domestic consumption little incursion you know pakistan won shoot beat the drums surgical strike and 200 killed bla bla bla and you got the elections one public asking for proof just celebrating like won everything govt should provide proof did indeed drop those munitions else all this just another jumla kaka for the impending election and not anty nashnol for thinking rationally and asking for proof ,1
key extracts from piece the new york times pakistan kashmir airstrikes html residents around balakot the scene the attack pakistan said they saw sign any significant damage from the airstrikes the view that little had been damaged was supported military analysts and two western security officials who said that any militant training areas the site the pakistani province khyber pakhtunkwha had long since packed dispersed earlier reports had placed the attack the pakistani side kashmir which nearby resident attar shisha village inside pakistan about miles from balakot said was woken loud explosions about tuesday was reached phone and asked remain anonymous out fear reprisal the pakistani authorities the villager said that jaish mohammed still ran school balakot but that the airstrikes missed the facility and hit empty ravine instead adding that there were casualties had heard balakot and its surrounding area hosted numerous militant training camps until 2005 when powerful earthquake struck the area devastating its towns and villages international aid groups poured provide relief militants packed their camps and went elsewhere avoid being detected analysts say “what they hit speculation for now — they say they hit terrorist camp but lot intelligence sources say those camps pakistan had been cleaned out recent days ” bedi said “this more political symbolism than anything else modi had show some demonstrable action india’ part ahead elections ”,1
meanwhile pakistan can even get back reconnaissance drone back safely ,1
now that india has accomplished the mission the best course action would downplay public and global front and let imran khan save face there lot pressure him retaliate which could lead full blown war the military could again have coup and get into power both cases are extremely bad for india better not tease the pakistanis too much like some moronic journalists are doing right right now those videos would public youtube and unite pakistan against india meanwhile india should keep the pressure private and communicate that this not isolated case would the course action after every future terrorist strike that might happen ,1

 amazing that iaf was able accomplish such clean cut strike foreign air space swiftly and stealthily with civilian casualties and little none responsive action from pakistani armed forces really impressed with the strategic abilities our air force however concerned about the aftermath the strike being reported can come conclusion the result find many conflicting announcements try unbiased possible and usually check out international media for news and now there clear concensus whether the strike killed large number terrorists not think the death ustad ghouri announced vijay gokhale will play major role validating our statement also think time will see clear picture and somewhere between what and pakistan are claiming let see meanwhile can you link any sources which you think can clear this out for ,1
 was lurking pakistan they got point that killing 300 people huge thing must reflected local news paper social media but such thing not reported thr may should wait for tomorrow coz local newspaper cover such things may was safety valve govt coz even after pulwama many soilder died various encounter lot anger among indian youth ,1
kudos iaf army intel for poking the eye when was looking out that said the technical narrative very interesting seems multiple iaf squadrons were dispatched across pak borders mirage 2000 aircrafts entered pak air space carry out the attack mirage 2000 though capable multirole not capable defending against pak f16 obviously some the mirages were defending the bombers even then they are not match for f16 either sukhoi role the operation not being mentioned for some reason sukhoi aircrafts didn enter pak air space media have been reporting that f16 came contact with the iaf squadron but backed off seeing the size iaf squadron which makes the case only aircrafts even more dubious also though 1000kg bomb like drdo glide capable producing casualties range 100 theory practical only all them were close range several those bombs might more likely for producing high casualties claimed media again only all them were same location ,1
has been confirmed that actual terrorists have been murdered not civilians checking the pak subreddit shows that human was injured they say can someone update what the current situation ,1
nuclear umbrella develops leak since the pakistani nuclear tests pakistan military has operated under the presumption that they can escalate much they want non conventionally but india will not respond conventionally for fear nuclear escalation the nuclear umbrella well this action just proved india doesnt give shit about the pakistani nukes and will not hesitate use its conventional superiority how many terrorists died immaterial that iaf was used instead special forces and that not just the loc but the actual border into pakistan was crossed the big news ,1
pak says the iaf violated the airspace and got inside around kms and when paki jets were scrambled they made retreat and dropping payload external fuel tank retreat faster how true you think this statement theirs ,1

 few bad people does bad thing entire community suffers the consequences humans are well known stereotype people and categorize people their minds based what they think those category people doesn have right all yet people are stupid enough that for example many people categorize women into separate category and stereotype them into thinking women should only this are expected xyz thing another example men must not cry now those were categorization based gender now there are categorization based all types things from skin color religion country wealth education job caste etc many people darker skin color still face discrimination lot countries example job based discrimination many people consider babas scamsters because several high profile babas getting into scandals that doesn mean there aren good babas out there doing real good work then criticize politicians singular category ohh politician must corrupt then criticize successful industrialists what jerk for having much wealth must have got cheating people all these categorization are bad and should not exist the ideal world but they people are stupid they make these things their mind you fall into any these categories then you suffer the consequences what other people with similar categories have done case muslims and hindus divide all started during the partition and the struggle after that millions people died people who survived will tell their children stories how evil that muslim hindu was who killed your grandpa this make the kids have distorted view the world where person that religion default huge boogeyman and due lack consistent interaction childhood the child grows with those thoughts his mind then each event which come across will categorize his mind ohh that person that religion did this this increases into hatred these issues get amplified someone that category does something really really bad which gets lot media attention this how feminists word for people advocating for equality gender suddenly started looking like negative word because actions few people who claimed feminist was bad that now people think all feminists are bad case muslims the current running stereotype around the world the association lot terrorist organizations with islam this makes people put people associate that with the stereotype sure there are terrorist organizations who are from other religions well but that not the point here people will see the attack and see the religion and just assume both are correlated together next time they come across someone who has those religion they becomes slightly suspicious the online world especially reddit where everyone anonymous these kinda suspicions get openly discussed and people become complete racists sexists and all other kind bad things have lot friends who are various religions including yours don care about religion care about what kinda person you are guess being someone from kerala also have something with this here did not have much inter religion struggle like what northern india had face during partition this means that people here generally not care about religion this means childhood where you get interact with people all backgrounds and thus such kinda hatred not there ,-1

online people would prefer low resolution version you your stereotype that stereotype very similar pakistani muslim name the resolution increased one may not have problem with you all but online space doesn allow for that don take seriously you are indian muslim you cannot even survive without hindu serving you one the other way same true for hindus they are being served indian muslims some way the other just take little lightly baggage past you might have assert you indian identity more than hindus but you can take rightly you can always proudly rather than annoyance your grandfather made prudent decision proud always remember that you are not just citizen this country but son this soil that relation you are brother ,1
you don have prove anyone you are indian first and will reflect your actions too just like this very genuine rant opinion most people get angry when they see something anti india and because many pakistanis lurk indian pages and they are muslims people quickly jump into conclusion but you might have noticed that anyone with muslim name comments something like pkmkb they get the highest likes and love from the same set you will also see indians supporting afganis and vice versa might turn into religios fight but deep down not ,1

read entire comment before reacting now you may personally uninvolved all this but can you understand where the distrust comes from their the muslims loyalty seems primarily pakistan this crime unpardonable general cariappa wrote this here the full article muslims voted for muslim league favour partition but when they got pakistan bangladesh east pakistan after tearing india they refused the land they wanted for themselves and now muslims chose stay india paraded they did india some favour staying read about direct action day muslims murdered and raped hindus sikhs the thousands the night october when the pakistani qabalis attacked kashmir the muslim soldiers the 4jak battalion the indian army killed hindu sikh soldiers their brothers arms commanding officers and joined the pakistani side this why brigadier rajinder singh had only 150 men hold uri against 8000 feat for which was awarded the first maha veer chakra the killings exodus kashmiri hindus the horrific story from ajmer sure you must aware the chisti family for years raped hindu girls hundreds hindu girls and hindu girls only visit any area that dominated muslim population they are ghettos where hindus are harrassed regularly and forced leave kairana much west bengal and many many more every day five times day hindus tolerate hate speech the name azaan loudspeakers that allah which hindus don believe the only god that mohamad his prophet that idol worship sin the very existence hindus sin muslim friend islamic teachings are anti idolators anti kaafirs like hindu quran calls for murder such kaafirs even muslims who don advocate killings believe that idol worship kufr and hindus are doomed because their shikr forget ram mandir ayodhya kashi vishwanath demolition and building gyanvaapi upon forget mathura and thousands those temples across india that have been demolished and over them mosques have been built show kaafirs their place even temples that are functioning are under attack regularly muslims regularly desecrate temples break the idols throw meat many time cows the temple premises muslims regularly indulge cow smuggling and cow murder just recently muslims killed man named ramalingam kerala because opposed religious conversion auraiya seven sadhus were tortured and murdered and their tongue cut off muslims because they opposed cow killing and further back history things are much much more brutal tipu sultan unleashed genocides hindus instance killed lakhs hindus diwali and bragged about this the nizam hyderabad another islamist till this day iyengars karnataka not celebrate diwali for this reason babur was particularly fond raising pillars heads kaafirs aurangzeb was also particularly brutal burying people alive walls sawing them half boiling them oil they refused convert other muslim kings whether akbar shah jahan any other nawabs nizams were also extremely brutal many genocides hindus happened throughout india the indian subcontinent who responsible for all this not muslims and the ideology islam yes there are individual muslims who are well natured good people but the root the ideology from which the mistrust grows islam most muslims not want islam change they refuse accept that there anything problems about and therein lies the problem for the muslim community introspect why they are hated not just india but around the world the europe china russia ,1

his disciples opposing the integration islamic culture the indian cultural
mainstream and urging the muslim community keep aloof from non muslims and even
non sunnis adopted traditional well rigidly doctrinal approach reforming the
muslim community india hence doing they the one hand failed see the
benefits western education opportunity that hindus were intelligent enough not miss the result which was felt the second half the nineteenth century when muslims found themselves trailing far behind their hindu fellow countrymen source 76iybwaaqbaj pa68 islamic nationalism emerged some areas where muslim communities were subjected foreign rule ved 0ahukewjc3zbasdzgahwnsh0khql6a2iq6aeikdaa onepage islamic 20nationalism 20emerged 20in 20some 20areas 20where 20muslim 20communities 20were 20subjected 20to 20foreign 20rule false like modern

eighteenth century that during the early phase british rule the indian
subcontinent where muslim community lived and ruled the country before the british
took over attention will mainly focused shah wali allah dehlavi prominent muslim figure that time who exerted long lasting impact later generations muslim nationalist
leaders south asia
shah wali allah regarded the british presence the subcontinent well what perceived threat posed the dormant hindu majority serious danger his
community saw the political decline muslims the subcontinent prelude total religious disintegration his fears were further accentuated the misunderstanding and some instances ignorance islam his community mainly result centuries long interaction with the hindu community well the recent contact with western
thought
hence shah wali allah was convinced that unless muslims went back their religion order face the challenge hinduism permanent decadence the muslim community india would undoubtedly ensue his opinion muslims india had preserve their
distinct identity being different from the rest the indian communities and particularly
the hindus order muslims should restrict their interaction with the latter else
islamic values would completely obliterated confirmed hafeez malik the below
statement while the hindu culture has always been assimilative and
willing synthesize with other religions islam had face the
problem preserving its distinct identity which closer cultural
relations with the hindu society would progressively erode shah wali allah uttered cry for islam danger the south asian subcontinent and muslim theologian felt duty bound something save his religion and religionists
from further disintegration thus and his followers embarked revivalist and
reformist campaign amongst the muslim community british india that encouraged
communal tendencies and attitudes common muslims only mainly religious thinking
towards that end urged his community return the islamic religion seek
salvation stated that only god can relied and muslims should stick god sacred
book namely the holy quran spear 224 225 fact staunchly believed that the holy quran was the one and only source that
provided guidance the right path well knowledge all humanity and that the real success for muslims the earthly life well after death parenthetically this stance shah walyi allah delhavi and his disciples vis vis non muslims and non sunnis reflects the rigidly sectarian character the approach their
revivalist movement mat ter fact many historians agree the fact that the leader this movement shah walyi allah delhavi was line with his contemporary mohammed
ibn abd wahhab one the most radical islamists who launched similar revivalist
movement the arabian peninsula historically known the wah habist movement the repudiation islamic aspects islam led shah waliy allah delhavi and his followers embark process islamisition the muslim society the indian subcontinent towards this end urged his religionists adhere the cultural values the muslim
world which were accepted and exemplified the prophet mohammed his sunna malik
1980 257 matter fact ing arab origin shah waliy allah delhavi called
upon his community keep aloof from the cultural mainstream the indian subcontinent
and not neglect the customs and mores the early arabs because they were the

scholars and and prominent leaders the indian nationalist movement mainly those who
adopted western nationalism ideology was accused having sowed the seeds disunity among the inhabitants the indian subcontinent which made difficult their
struggle for freedom from the yoke british colonialism
for instance undertone regret banerjee stated that shah wali allah separatist tendency resulted the fact that “although they—indian muslims—were india they would not india” banerjee the meantime upadhyay
confirms this point stating that shah wali allah “emphasis arabization indian islam did not allow the emotional integration indian muslims with the
rest the population this country ” added regressively affecting the muslim
psyche his ideology debarred from forward looking vision” upadhyay 2003 another
article upadhyay declared that “the religio political ideology wali ullah made permanent crack hindu muslim relation this sub continent which undermined the self pride and dignity integrated indian society”
shah wali allah and his like minded muslim fellows were preaching among their community
was nothing more than different form nationalism whereby they aimed the
cultivation feeling belonging larger group people indeed appealing coreligionists join the worldwide muslim community their objective was create rather extend the already existing muslim nation called “ummah” ",1

people here are claiming that the aim 120 amraam missile could have also been used jf17 and thus its not conclusive proof that f16 was used however you check the wikipedia page for the jf17 armament thunder block shows that the latest block version doesn use the aim 120 missile furthermore checked almost all the websites that show the first page google when you search jf17 armament and not single one them including pakistani military blog showed the aim 120 amraam missile being part jf17 package furthermore from what checked none the planned versions the jf17 use the aim 120 missile either you still don believe the paf jet was f16 the iaf avm said that they have the radar signature the plane hope that would enough for you ,1

many people are posting that why did use mig could have used better jets may have been due end use agreement between the manufacturer other jets and the buyer cum user india the end use agreement defines the rights given the buyer for the usage the weapon weapon buying country breaks those agreements then weapon exporting country can block exports parts and block repairs may even use built hardware trojans rare case but still possibility one reason for using mig maybe that mig has such end use agreements russians gave the full transfer technology and manufacturing rights the 1960s lesson for future improve local manufacturing weapons edit the fact that asked pakistan not use without their permission raises concerns for purchasing foriegn weapons source ,1

with all the hubub about the f16s are overlooking something else they entered our airspace with aircrafts and our jets responded them let reiterate that aircraft for context when bombed the jem camp balakot used mirage 2000s this was not just show that they can enter our territory this was clearly strike force while before was not 100 sure that they wanted bomb military installations because that would blatant act war jets definitely for bombing run now according former air chief marshal tipnis who appeared ndtv just few moments ago missed part what said post summary what did hear the iaf representative the was bit muted and didn provide all the evidence because they didn want escalate the situation thats the case don blame them our media channels already declared war yesterday definitely won trust the media handle this appropriate manner said that jets shows that they were clearly bombing run and speculated that they might have been trying take out critical infrastructure like the srinagar airfield said that the iaf intercepted the planes soon they crossed the loc and that the paf wasn expecting this level preparedness and thus turned back hastily still talking ndtv was talking about wing commander abhinandan edit look this comment below ,1
 guess f16 came back bite their ass they pissed and trump they were given f16 defend and not attack trump has already called their bull shit past guess arm twisted them returned the pilot because other then that don see why the country who was trying use him bargaining chip suddenly turned all santa india has stuck the script that was attack our military installations pakistan can deny that infact they were thumping their chest not all over their air space still closed black out will happening soon and the money they are guzzling will accounted world back for them kudos our government for not giving into shit and releasing statement and taking them back unlike pakistan who are caught with their pants down ,-1

the mea guy coordinating the press conference absolute talent what his name single handedly coordinating everything ,1
here take india probably destroyed something importance otherwise pakistan wouldn have cordoned off the area claims ready take media the site but cannot due bad weather also probably missed one two the targets due paf responding and hit whole lot nothing also clear that pakistan has used and remember that their initial claim was indian jets down with pilots arrested india has always maintained two jets were down but only only was indian furthermore they later said only pilots arrested with one the hospital and then changed the story and again and said only one pilot arrested clear two jets have been downed and one pilot definitely has been theirs you might hate modi kaka but indian military personnel has always been credible unlike the pakistani counterparts ,-1
 all are absolutely stupid you think that was nothing here the narrative that pakistan has put out far indian jets entered our territory and got beaten back our jets they dropped payload but missed and there was nothing hit anyways then show that too can infiltrate india sent our jets which none were f16s and dropped minor payloads open spaces and not any military civilian installation then indian jets entered our territory and shot down jet and captured pilot the fact that have recovered weaponry which only used f16s thus shows that the above was lie they lied about not using f16s they lied about the not targeting military installations hitting military installations act war they lied about the number planes they shot down and the number our pilots they captured keep mind the air vice marshal stated that they had evidence for balakot strikes well but the govt decided not release maybe they only killed terrorists and the government wants save face with all the lies that pakistan has said why hard believe that they lied about the other stuff like balakot well wouldn the first time far thought pakistan had the upper hand diplomatically speaking they were ahead goi and already had narrative place narrative which convinced least part lot people here including myself but this changes everything imran khan said that they weren conducting any military operations and wanted peace then why did they send f16s plane they are only supposed use against terrorists against and targeted military installations understand the statements the press conference were bit jarring with all the talk about being ready but the move set wing commander abhi free was clearly not expected anyone thats why they delayed the press conference they also didnt say whether was act war because our country doesn want the first declare war thats where this headed also absolutely believe the avm when said they have more evidence its tactical move not release now case pakistan lies again can use the previous few hours were uneventful but the next few are definitely going interesting the ball pakistan court now lets see what happens edit just clarify not warmongering fearmongering was just stating the facts and explaining why the evidence the iaf provided crucial sincerely hope find peaceful and diplomatic way end this edit some people claiming that the amraam also used the jf17 will have more research and confirm this still doesn change the fact that they targeted military installations ,1
 think this how things might have gone yesterday paf violates indian airspace iaf intercepts mig shoots f16 and f16 shoots the mig both fall pok pakistan makes the claim that shot down two jets india starts searching for the pilot the f16 and mig villagers seems have seen parachutes however very soon this news was contained suspecting short operation might have taken place bring the pilot back which the reason think there was delay also the pakistan claim two jets true then might have been the reason they went against their word that they had two pilots their custody 16s pakistan can used for offence its against the contract that they have with the also this works perfectly their favour both the jets landed their court they got the advantage the moment the jets crashed there note this just assumption ,1

 think all makes sense now india provided solid proof being used this against the usage policy that were signed pak and before delivery was supposed used only against terrorist but was used against another country military establishments that too not defence this made trump angry since already upset about all the aids and whatnots being given pakistan and hence immense pressure was put pakistan which lead the release iaf pilot also add the diplomatic pressure from other countries well great win for mea india correct wrong ,1

 very far from bhakt and have faith the indian media and hate this indian political establishment that said the indian armed forces have given reason doubt them they say f16 was downed believe them salute their bravery anger with this political establishment does not change through this episode though continue believe that the air strikes reeked bad planning not from the military perspective but from strategy perspective communication geo political etc they should expected pakistan retaliate how did they expect escalate from the step and what was with the terrible and allowing the media run amok with their wild speculation based unnamed sources also continue believe that must escalate immediately have far more lose economically war than pakistan been given opening with the return our pilot this game one manship with pakistan trying prove who right must not lose sight the bigger picture fighting the terrorists ,-1

 find funny how finished his address sat down then waited for the speaker start speaking then interrupted him deliver the news that they will realising wing commander abhinandan such small thing for them that completely escaped his mind lmao the theatrics politicians resort for optics certainly not just pakistani thing universal trait all politicians ,1
the evidence shown much bigger than the evidence that was not shown because proves two things pakistan initiated war was against military installations and secondly they had indeed f16 which they have denied all along this breaks the contract that they had with when they got the f16 there could several repurcussions for this act pakistan from across the world ,1
 the flight lieutenant then was the first and only prisoner war the 1999 kargil war nachiketa was captured pakistan may 1999 and was repatriated india june that year while video footage abhinandan being treated well the pakistani army has been doing the rounds social media nachiketa eight day stay pakistani custody was different — filled with severe mental and physical torture was very tough can describe that experience words that time thought maybe death simpler solution but thankful god that destiny was side underwent severe mental and physical torture there for three four days nachiketa told hindustan times during interview 2016 while nachiketa thought that would never return said there comes point where you think ‘death simpler’ but fortunately for the third degree part which the last part didn’ start for pilot abhinandans capture pakistan brings back memories kargil war hero kambampati nachiketa 3591971 html,1

weak bait but will bite you have any bit logical reasoning you would able get your answer after yesterday 27th attacks pakistan and the subsequent capture the iaf pilot the entire country hates pakistan and pakistanis you are extremely emotional with deep wounds partition that anger will amplified doesn mean that all pakistanis are bad similarly the terrorists attacking india have been all muslims exception kashmiris celebrating the attack too were muslims there widespread belief about muslims keeping religion before country which particularly irksome for lot people times like this forget that there are millions muslims army and police why would you not able connect the dots with the attack pulwama and the hate against specific religion couple with the very bad wounds partition and perhaps you understand why the muslims are being hated ,-1
the complete media silence from our government despicable the country going through one its most trying times recent memory but the leaders are dead quiet support assurance show strength other than covert operations foreign leaders have spoken out before our own have pathetic ,-1
 this creepy and from years ago ,-1
 customary disclaimer about how patriotic indian concerned about the state affairs country the recent exchanges between the indian and the pakistani armed forces and how the governments both countries have used certain narratives highly troublesome opinion after the pulwama attack india claimed that iaf attacked jem camp and called preemptive attack simultaneously amit shah going around the country election campaigns and citing revenge and teach lesson his speeches asking for votes these are very contradicting outlooks and while all being lapped engaged and enraged audience puts serious question marks the integrity the current government pakistan the other hand has said suffered damages the iaf attack there are stories air raid site casualties mysterious madrassa 190227183058957 html going around where claimed that the iaf just destroyed some trees since then they have also circulated videos indian pilot captivity and mostly the rhetoric has been how being treated with respect and care now coming what really concerns that the citizens both countries are failing see through the political narratives already embarrassing for india that while delayed accepting any indian pilot being captured there were videos circulating online proving biggest fear right now that more proof comes forward the iaf strike not achieving much further questions are asked will become ego issue for modi inch chest and will see more retaliation and this retaliation mind you will not have much effect the kashmir issue terrorism but will pandering voter base pakistanis the other hand the light these skirmishes have completely forgotten that fairly established fact today that their government and military have created environment where harbouring terrorists and denying the same the norm and the pakistani government and military shifting the spotlight from that onto exchanges with india and how unfair india its assessments writing this post with appeal for citizens both countries see beyond political agendas and realise that war even these skirmishes are very dangerous for two countries which should basically focussing growth want encourage debate how make citizens more aware and how not fall for politically motivated narratives and ofcourse heavily biased media both sides not helping the cause will for sure get some flak for questioning the veracity the iaf attacks the jem camp but find worthy questioning don think today day and age with widespread access internet nothing destroyed camp and almost 300 dead terrorists has leaked onto the internet even pakistan whole country collectively tried hide that news would prove quite difficult but hope most redditers can move beyond that and understand the real concern behind questioning that ,1
imran khan release your man indian media \ pakistan forced release our hero \ pakistan forced back off come indian media stay patriotic but don twist when you don need pakistan playing strategic game here doubt their call for peace might genuine even for self preservation but what show more mature face just say our man now going safe and end there why become propaganda pawn willy nilly ,1
 seems pretty clear intervened and there was severe international pressure would have also had some choice words say pakistan using f16s pakistan also cannot afford ongoing conflicts due their abysmal foreign exchange reserves has played this well for his people indians who believe pakistan genuinely doing this gesture goodwill are either too naive too young remember the numerous times the past pakistan backstabbed india after agreeing talks for modi speculation rife that india will release proofs the air strikes press conference today india managed pull those off successfully with further losses seems the case now major victory for modi proofs are released think may have been outmaneuvered the international stage the capture abhinandan sure greatly complicated india plans however the domestic front not think his reputation will suffer any losses seems the case india mig shot down that may the first instance eastern aircraft shooting down western aircraft since god knows when vietnam incredible and props our pilot who did ,1

 what with the negative reactions here yes disappointing that balakot evidence wasnt provided but expected balakot inside pakistan way could have verified everything but just hours ago people here were claiming f16 wasn used this clear proof that has been used far the paf story seemed concrete but now you can see the holes appearing they had lied about the f16s why stretch believe that they lode about balakot and everything else ,-1

that good hear honestly seems like peaceful conclusion most likely this scenario because neither side really has much gain and lot lose and the root cause this specific situation terrorist attack that neither state had causal hand seems like once emotions cool that logic will prevail also while important note that pakistan and india have fought several wars before they have not had major conflict since both went nuclear ,1

some more bits his speech front parliament not chronological order how said them the only purpose our strike was demonstrate our capability and will said prime minister imran khan while addressing the house did not want inflict any casualty india wanted act responsible manner khan said tried call indian narendra modi the phone yesterday because escalation not our interests nor india the prime minister reiterates that talks over kashmir are important have feeling that the indian public does not agree with the current government warmongering their media had seen what our media has seen over the past years referring the war terror pakistan has had suffer they would not have created this war hysteria india should ask why kashmiri youth resorted suicide attack says khan khan said that although india had blamed suicide attacks islamic radicalism was common tactic employed hindu fighters belonging the tamil tigers prior they weren doing because their religion suicide attacks are weapon the weak they are done out desperation the said added that india had blamed pakistan for the attack without proof shouldn they asking why year old agreed become human bomb asked referring the video the kashmiri youth who had claimed responsibility for the pulwama attack you cannot send idea jail khan questions indian policy kashmir all this issue because kashmir want ask the indian public about all that has happened over the past years there indigenous movement kashmir one point kashmiri leaders had not wanted separation but because indian brutality today all they demand independence einstien’ theory madness doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different result how long will pakistan blamed for everything kashmir and asked take action without any proof pakistani media was very mature they didn any war mongering but was upsetting see the kind war hysteria created india its media says offered dialogue india but response not good,1

very nice hear the situation escalate this point bith countries seems have achieved their objectives although the relative «winner» would say pakistan the pak army has proved its relevance pak politics and thus budget cuts and security while india showed takes shit the reason why ’ say pakistan «won» gained more prestige that they not only shot down indians planes but also showed responsibility now releasing the pilot while its army showed mercy the video the capturing and rescuing the pilot from angry crowds there slight chance further escalation india but this point seems that the chances gains for india outweighs the risk further escalation and humiliation edit although think india could skillfully keep the situation current levels thus keeping pak airspace closed and therefore loose money ,1

 going disagree here not with the part dealing your parents behavior with you but definitely the part where see imran khan and peace the same sentence before labelling bhakt modi fan war mongering hyper nationalist just listen out after that you feel there factual inconsistency there some loophole argument free engage with you and hear you you must first understand that imran khan isn the saint what the world trying make him just because sounds convincing and uses words like peace and logic doesn anyway reflect his stance and policies terrorists pakistan facade long used pakistan and has been there modus operandi project image peaceloving nation and often claiming the victim terrorism imran khan himself has used the army come the power and the pakistani army hands glove with isi helps terrorists they anti terrorists they should thanking for destroying the terrorists even certain sections want praise the indians for this they won because then they have answer the questions following like how long had these terrorists camps had been operating and what are the steps the pakistani govt taking counter such camps far the release indian pilot concerned they had release him because the don have much choice per the protocol and given the present situation and they want projected thr the nice guys when sushma swaraj says was preemptive strike not against any nation but terrorist outfits and return indian defence installations are attacked about which now have evidence the f16 shot down presented during the army press briefing should enough botheration what were pakistani jets trying accomplish not undermine the sovereignty the indian state the indian side says aren targeting the pakistani army and return pakistani air force tries bomb indian defence establishment then who escalating the war this logic they should also attack usa because the americans fucked laden pakistani soil and despite known for harbouring terrorists over decades they still have the fuckin audacity talk about peace peace isn not retaliating and protecting people peace taking care that insidious activities take place your sovereign territory and looking that those who disturb peace are brought justice really embrace imran khan can arrest the likes hafiz saeed masood azhar and long list terrorists both recognized the and the the indian agencies but until that day will only hypocrite and nothing else tommorow know that stern action taken against such people might even nominate him for the peace prize but should prove that has the balls and even after all these facts you trying say the indian side that wants war then that equivalent victim shaming the rest leave your fine sense judgement but please learn read between the lines the world would have been lot better place people were actually what they portray cms asia 44965868,1

 continuing from the kashmir post where comments were locked think there are some routes that can taken article 35a removal this very controversial article probably utmost importance least according what hear and read arbitrarily gives the state legislature powers that have place the kind democracy functioning india our democracy has been often criticized quasi federal federal with unitary bias because ours was experiment that had never even been conceived let alone tried anywhere the world land with multitudes language cultures and religions function democracy would either fall apart turn into autocracy the majority were the prevailing views 1947 there reason usa placed itself strategically closer pakistan hypothesized its homogeneity would help grow faster and remain stable india belied all their hopes the reason sheer ingenuity our constitution and inhuman capabilities our earlier leaders kashmir throughout remained out the loop due the very article question the example berlin before 1989 when east and west berlin existed eastern half was under communist regime ussr and the western under three nations usa and france the west was developed under open market economics while being financially helped the three nations east simultaneously remained stagnant and suffered akin the other balkan nations the easterners could see the west developing and wanted flee that side much that east germany government built the historic berlin wall could for starters remove the article 35a and allow free movement every sense accord with the constitution the kashmiris would want whats happening say mumbai bangalore than multan even bloody sinkiang region china thus exposure the wide world and idea what lies fully integrated himachal pradesh often the highest preforming state many indexes revered and often read immediate neighbor kashmir they won even have far and manage that who knows pok revolts join the mainstream kashmir just like the berlin wall fell 1989 must prove action time for theory crafting long past for investors shying away keynesian economics state where private investment dries public investment must step our government can spend 3600 cores statue with roi sight developing state the very breathing living people constitutionally bound serve will always find funds education due article 35a not many good schools could operate ratio the population demand the kashmiri pandit exodus drove away the majority educated populace this resulted young children aged attending madarsas for education when they graduated the age nearly years indoctrination resulted jilted attitude towards the nation large and extreme religious outlook the maulvis these madarsas often instilled separatist and jihadist thoughts inside these very impressionable brains also the lack exposure the rest the country meant these could not washed away when society taught something without external stimuli they become sounding boards for each other and and reinforce their self imposed thoughts painstakingly long process but probably the only one these are some the \ points could think right now but there are many many ways can bring them back internet the last remaining democracy let loose the jio adventure them when they see the lifestyle average mumbai bangalore citizen and compare with that any big pakistani city average citizen mind you they will know where secularism will lead and where religious indoctrination you can wish away disaster nor fight with weapons idea and very destructive idea has made home their brains what must slowly but surely ,1

for people still doubting that paf used f16s ask yourself one question the paf didn use f16s and the iaf put out blatant lie why haven they come out and called out the iaf already wouldn beneficial pakistan and detrimental india they called out india maj gen ashif gharoor was quick respond with tweets about the air strikes and the capture our pilot where now its almost been entire day since the press conference pakistan has said nothing even though there are huge implications for them they use f16 this enough proof that f16 was indeed used yet some pakistanis are coming with bullshit evidence that strays further and further away from reality show that f16 wasn used ,1
man pakistan botch even greater than their mandatory run out cricket ,1
 pakistani journalists who tweeted the video are also scrambling delete now looks like the orders from the powers that arrived after they realised the backlash the video drew what huge huge blunder ,1

some light why government not releasing any image video evidence strike lot talk about evidence iaf strike there are number reasons for government not release any video picture per one canadian mate who read extensively wars image and video strike can further fuel extremist propoganda for revenge can lead more deliberate terrorist attack provide motivation for existing radical extremist for revenge attack taliban and isis use american strike footages their propoganda material recruit west images and video could give furthe more support jem from these organisations also give reveal our technical capabilities and intel pak both pak military and extremist estimate our strength and reach pakistan denying our strike good for india pakistani people see images killed people and destruction there will extreme anger against india could lead more sympathy for jem this could lead more recruit for jem calm people pak gov may come under pressure pursuit more offensive attack india public opinion shape lot gov policy even after releasing image and video there good chance lot propoganda reportting will carried deny the fact and devide public opinion see what happing with story last there are lot assessment gone into this decision releasing images and video which have both short and long term implications his take have wait least years for images and video strike depends regional security situation there are lot occasion history where enemy party release their war achievement evidence bring down moral opposition and withheld evidence keep dark the above part not mine but comment posted another user which have copy pasted here ,1

 pakistan’ ambassador the united states during the mumbai attacks witnessed firsthand the american efforts smooth out india pakistan tensions president george bush secretary state condoleezza rice and national security adviser stephen hadley spoke the phone with prime ministers both countries multiple times the cia shared intelligence that enabled pakistan arrest several individuals connected with the attacks but after the immediate threat indian retaliation had passed pakistan backed away from punishing the attack’ masterminds and perpetrators source ,1
 bit conflicted about the air strikes one hand iaf has not released any evidence yet the other highly doubt our armed forces would such grave steps violating the undisputed airspace another country without proper intel and drop bombs just trees and not hit anything saying this even after considering that modi might have pushed for remember the armed forces care lot about their reputation much that they didn cross the loc during the karfil war personally think that they waiting for pakistan respond yesterday press conference before releasing further info and evidence hopes catching pakistan another lie also maybe they didn want jeapardize the return abhinandan ,1
 abhinandan has been coerced make statement front pak ,0
 don see how people are concluding that india has come out black faced and embarrassed don believe imran khan also don believe modi they politicians who lie don believe pakistan army they been caught lying all the time including yesterday but give one reason that indian armed forces have given you not believe them there evidence denying any claim made them india has showed the world that can retaliate cross border terrorism have repelled the cross border misadventure pakistan shooting down one jet theirs losing one ours process got one our pilots captured them this has been the only low point the captured pilot will released pakistan accepts they harbour maulana masood azhar now anyone who thinks that these two things happened because pakistan suddenly decided the right thing without crumbling international pressure definitely dumb pakistan has tried very hard show the world that they are peace lovers has worked indian public but were actually true why there continued diplomatic pressure from the international community them act undeniably the narrative being still held indians pakistan losing its face although leaking videos which themselves was violation international diplomatic conventions they are trying their best make success unfortunately working some the common people ,1

why everyone calling this modi war game isn the person who made the decision the airstrikes isn the one behind the intelligence this was done the iaf based intelligence and information modi does not have the necessary education military procedures intelligence the ability order and make such strikes actually none our politicians only the army does stop crediting the force and strikes modi just you guys can quench your far left thirst beating him with calling failure based unreliable media and information from the enemy one knows what happened balakot except pakistani army and indian army none them released any credible information evidence prove disprove the damage edit might take credit but that taking credit for what the army did did not orchestrate the strikes now and even during the surgical strike suggest the replies any for this comment should from indians only and not the pakistani users who have invaded the sub since yesterday ,-1

what were previous pms speaking think they all spoke hindi and media translates can speak gujarati too but doesn’ use outside gujarat this serious question there proposal you are speaker regional respectfully saying not trigger then you can look that language’ media and they will show translated clip whatever they are keen show not political conspiracy force hindi rest the nation even sonia gandhi speaking hindi may just that most population either understands uses dialect for national politics makes practical sense now pulling this all from memory admit that grew the north the country but eager hear there was speaking other indian language when speaking the masses ,1
question from american here what are your official languages you not actually have any official languages like the mean the has official language the books but everything here english like memory serves there exactly one single road sign the whole the the united states that not english guess question what are your official languages the books what are your official languages ,1
several reasons can think speaking english would reduce his audience even further only the economically well off would able follow him fluently can express himself more effectively hindi than english sounds bit comical english and very impressive hindi imo from the sangh parivar after all and they are pretty insistent using hindi the link language among indians this has always been problem india you think about people especially those the lower strata the society non hindi speaking areas get reports what was said national leaders hindi english from the vernacular media incidentally this also how people the hindi belt come know what leaders other regions say they get translated into english hindi other indian languages most middle and upper class people india wager are least somewhat functional hindi english even say that this less problem these days than was years ago ,1
most the seats are the hindi belt another reason why one from south north east can ever become the foreseeable future ,1
 most comfortable hindi and gujarati and since hindi has the largest share speakers uses hindi ,1

 naraimha rao didn’ speak hindi well used english mostly for his speeches you ignore urban english speaking population that represents about india rest can communicate only their respective native tongue hindi other local language they picked the amount diversity have ’ not simply possible find one language that can address entire nation think technology can used provide subtitles the recorded speech videos for live feed ’ difficult synchronize subtitles ,1

 been closely following the news the claims the debunking claims etc and think that have theory what exactly happened the air engagement that let the indian pilot capture first all though you need bear mind that war government military including india and pakistan always speaks 100 truthfully for different reasons they actually believe that what they are saying correct the time that they said this especially true air air combat where every war history all sides claim have shot down more planes than were actually shot down air combat can confusing due the speeds and distances involved they are trying protect military operational secrets tell lies publically order maintain military secret good example this was the 1991 gulf war where the and saudi kept claiming that almost all the iraqi scud missiles were successfully intercepted patriot missiles order get iraq stop trying fire the missiles the reality was that the patriots only hit minority incoming missiles they know that don know the truth for sure but with whatever information they have that information helps with the morale their own fighting forces and civilians this why for example ww2 many pilots would get credit the kills they claimed even when solid proof was missing with that said what know about the aerial engagement pakistan said that indian planes chasing its retaliatory strike entered pakistani space initially pakistan claimed planes were shot down one pilot custody and one hospital pakistan later officially changed that one plane mig and one pilot india agreed that they chased the strike said immediately that they were chasing 16s and claimed have shot down one them pakistan denied using 16s the operation said was 17s india then days later claimed they had electronic signatures data indicating 16s were involved and then produced wreckage from amraam aim 120 missile saying that 16s are the only planes south asia than can fire that missile now lets look the actual evidence mig shot down solid proof photos and video the wreck and pilot evidence 2nd indian plane shot down evidence but pakistan officially stopped claiming this shot down evidence all the photo evidence india claimed has now been proven false third party experts 16s involved the aim 120 wreckage pretty damning initial claims that was sold taiwan have been denied taiwan and based experts have said that the overall sale package that include the missile covered both taiwan and pakistan the missile likely have been sold pakistan however the aim 120 long range missile over 100km mile range and not missile that pakistan would use close range encounter like the one that india claimed occured india said they fired heat seeking missiles which has 30km mile range the amraam very unlikely have been fired from the information saying that the could fire them very old from around 2008 and all recent information says that they only fire the chinese version the missile instead amraam could not fired from plane with chinese radar like the does missiles are compatible only with the radar systems they were built for how you reconcile all this theory which fits the available evidence below pakistan had plan retaliate dropping bombs indian kashmir mission profile 17s strike element crossing into indian airspace 16s were used long distance escort using long range aim 120 missiles from safely deep inside pakistani airspace 17s dropped bombs just before the indian migs were interception range they turned round and burned hard for pakistani space the mig 21s chased them hard and are faster than 17s almost catching them before hitting the border the indian wing commander made the call hot pursuit that brought them range fire missiles 17s used flares evade the missiles but since the missiles still detonated close enough the pakistani planes that looked like kill the indian pilots the from distance looks lot like and could visually confused more this later but the same time once the indians were pakistani space the 16s range fired least one amraam taking out mig either wreckage from that missiles was carried into india inertia more likely second amraam missed its target perhaps because the second mig was diving away while using countermeasures and ended india why pakistan initially though got planes kill and then one missile fired resulting the target rapidly losing altitude and why india thought got kill also explains why the amraam part ended india and explains why pakistani denied the use 16s not trying give away that they use long range amraam missiles cover the escape strike planes the indian plane that got away would have brought with electronic data showing that was getting painted the kind radar that the carries this together with the easy confuse misidentification the with would have led india convinced that they were only fighting 16s and not 17s like they actually were for the issue why pakistan initially claimed one pilot custody and one hospital that simple ispr the time had pieces information work into immediate press release the time pakistan claimed have shot down planes indian pilot was reported have been taken into custody indian pilot was hospital getting treated the time ispr had make statement was not clear them that the indian pilot taken into custody was then taken hospital and was thus the same pilot they reported hospital since they thought there were different indian pilots that fitted well with the claims they had the time planes being shot down ,1

 don’ know about paf doctrine and would surprised they ever make that public ’ just trying reason why and how pakistan would use long range missile all know that during engagement which india’ own admission was short ranged pakistan used expensive missile that underperforms close ranged engagements where missile maneuverability key the logical explanation that the plan that fired the missile was nowhere close its target especially doesn’ make sense because almost all photos where you see 16s almost any nation when they have long range amraams they are also carrying short ranged highly maneuverable sidewinder missiles too ,1

just theory but think indian jets were hit one being and other being mig one video locals said they saw parachutes and ispr initially stated they caught with one other soldier drifting iok the may have hit f16 which may have been used defensively intercept them but not used offensively for crossing loc part mission that why india have that missile amraam 120 also fell indian side now india doesn want accept that lost they initially denied the existence their pilots and then revised only one pilot mia pakistan army used that statement their own favor and revised the count only one pilot being captured the mig guy abhinandan and using him peace gesture while having 2nd guy for interrogation this gave india the chance claim that the mig brought down f16 change narrative from not hitting the target pakistan using f16 offensively edit parachutes being one from our f16 pilot while other being indian and another 4th one who landed indian side which local might have missed maybe f16 was never shot down and all parachutes were indian soldiers ,-1
excellent translations you got there thanks for doing that and really agree with you for most your opinion madness power sounds damn stupid lmao just several own opinion here and not sure anyone has already commented this the shao lin 金刚伏魔‘ should 金刚不破’ and the other saying right 金刚不坏‘ which both mean vajra unbreakable pretty sure there such saying 金刚伏魔’ shao lin quotes because would sounded weirder than madness power lol the second thing want add about nuxia believe there another quote when she deflects sounds like 送你一程‘ something like that heard right can translated send you your death let send you die your death overall think the quotes length are all right because actually the other characters quotes are all about the similar length ubisoft did good job these quotes and voices different languages except madness power god that stupid and much more stupid when you translate and say mandarin ,1

they organisation under their affiliation are involved bomb attacks train bus majid they have been involved riots they are openly giving hate speeches etc they are terrorist organisation pakistan has jaish india has rss they are involved different level terrorism but terrorism nevertheless ,-1
 grandfather worked for the rss during early days the very decade india got independence and gandhi was assassination passed away years back used tell stories about his time the rss and pretty much agreed with being terrorist organisation according him the only thing stopping the rss the constitution india which vastly different from those islamic countries organisations like vhp abvp bajrang dal etc are organisations run the rss members they the dirty work for the rss including but not limited lynching the name cow harassment unmarried couples and riots the rss being the parent bjp national party wouldn like name attached all the dirty work they sanathan sanstha most definitely terrorist organisation chidambaram former home minister upa once declined declare terrorist organisation 67nsqrsoa6eslb299fnmvk html ,-1

about being anti national you should tell many people possible that rss didn support the indian national flag didn support the indian constitution after independence they only accepted after they were banned history shows how patriotic the rss really throughout india freedom struggle the rss was subservient the british with its leadership prohibiting participation mass movements hindutva nationalism rss etho religious cultural extremist group many the heir members are implicated violence but rss not literally terrorist group today you look objective analysis what typically constitutes working terrorist groups bajrang dal could qualify terrorist group although these would equivalent mafia drug cartel violent groups sanathan sanstha though most likely terrorist group ,1
they are the textbook definition terror group look the wiki definition terrorism the unlawful use violence and intimidation especially against civilians the pursuit political aims does the rss fit under this category let see consider then that this the most powerful non state outfit india with real opposition besides the police theory consider then that pursuit their aims the group has spawned multiple sub groups which are far more violent than they are their student wing the abvp has strong history intimidation the bajrang dal are notorious the vhp even more together talking about millions members qaeda its peak has some 000 today given their size reach and degree cultural intimidation they genuinely strike terror across india the last years people have started getting afraid voicing themselves saying certain things doing certain things certain days day supporting certain parties public sure the right will disagree and come with reasons why rss isn close something like jem that why sticking the idea terror itself boils down one fundamental difference indians are not afraid islamic terrorists are more prone rise against them than cower from them mumbai went back work the very next day after general indian people feel collective sense fuck you terror groups that instills sense collective confidence but indian people are afraid the rss and its families affected the way speak live think and make friends especially the last few years has found out how tough even maintain familiy bonds when discussing this topic see altogether how many friends have been lost uncles ignored and even fathers and mothers distanced from because how divisive the air has become the rss and its families make far more afraid people than all the islamic terrorists ever have through effective political mobilization and through ensuring they don get arrested for terror terror tricks fate they enjoy what islamic terrorists don enjoy success influence and power knowledge though would say that people mix the rss and the other groups that come under the sangh parivar tough say who more violent than the others but names like the vhp hindu mahasabha bajrang dal are key players note this distinction the rss ideological hub but may not the one directly coordinating acts terrorizing india maybe that title could the abvp lynching family demands 691783 html who create climates fear and intimidation every university they are the vhp who are most prominent valentine day less this year though the bajrang dal hindu mahasabha this group actively massacred muslims front gandhi during the partition riots difficult say who worse than the other and not sure myself you might find that the rss link more causal than direct many attacks indian citizens view they well all their supporters are guilty creating climate terror ,1
they are right wingers but not qualify terrorist group even the doesn qualify dedicated hardcore rss member compared nitin gadkari ,1

they helped hari singh conduct genocide kashmiri muslims killed between 000 100 000 men women and children right before signed over kashmir since then they functioned the same way that the white citizens councils the did the wcc would use the kkk conduct lynchings and terrorist attacks against minorities keeping themselves insulated from legal action here the rss uses the vhp bajrang dal etc conduct physical violence that they can escape legal action ,1

 was caught similar debate ‘saffron terror’ and sympathizer the group said ‘ what rss has never instigated been involved any incident outside india ’  yes they are right wing and nationalist organization that have taken the responsibility protecting faith however personally ’ rather have arya samaj chinmaya mission promote and preserve faith rather than radical order provide muscle and giving fascist tone their propaganda you’ stir hornet’ nest each time you link rss with the word ‘terror’ incidents history have given reason and left sour taste the mind peaceful hindus rss have been involved abetting riots and vigilantism many occasion they have narrowly missed being classified ‘terrorist’ outfit ,1

not terrorist organization imo but groups surrounding them such bajrang dal vhp are fucking terrorist they are isi india ,-1
imho anyone thing that teaches you hate another person religion caste nation etc should classified terrorist group ,-1
you can call rss terrorist group but that doesn mean rss equivalent qaeda let jem isis etc most people call rss terrorist group equate them with groups like which immediately comes mind when you hear terrorism this categorically false and very harmful political discourse the long run what you are actually doing here expanding the range what public perception considers terrorism using certain buzzwords this way how end with words losing their entire meaning like when anything right center fascism nazism and anything left center marxism communism ,1
 person who has seen rss work close can safely say that they are terrorist organisation little story hail from uttarakhand which was hit deadly rains and cloud bursts 2013 the flash floods were bad many small children lost their parents guardians caretakers rss went there are brought orphaned children into their offices where these kids live rss also pays for their education know this because the rss guys are neighbhbors and the complex which the children are housed located beside house now all know how gunda rss can but they also lot positive work towards the society rss sewaks had great hand cleaning and restoring the areas affected floods state imo their pros outweigh their cons ,1
 the supreme court india prevention act specified the following definition terrorism whoever with intent overawe the government law established strike terror the people any section the people alienate any section the people adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections the people does any act thing using bombs dynamite other explosive substances inflammable substances lethal weapons poisons noxious gases other chemicals any other substances whether biological otherwise hazardous nature such manner cause likely cause death injuries any person persons loss damage destruction property disruption any supplies services essential the life the community detains any person and threatens kill injure such person order compel the government any other person abstain from doing any act commits terrorist act source wikipedia now you can decide yourself qualifies for being called terrorist organisation not you ask for opinion confused looking into this definition written the most complicated way guess you should ask this law student lmao ,1

 terrorist just overused general word feel nowadays any act violence termed terrorism including violence state forces nonetheless answer your question based perception rss has hardline stance certain issues and they probably want impose this indian public through politics bjp litigation propaganda through media and conferences the garb social service and publications they are certainly one those groups that impose their ideology you and not educate you true sense long they are law abiding and legal they cannot termed terrorists although some people affiliated with rss have taken law unto themselves silence those who oppose them cannot termed terrorist organisation because institution that directly doesn condone terror terrorist organisation one that does this from top bottom personal belief rss top brass doesn necessarily imply endorse this stance though certain members are possibly culpable that makes difficult classify them terrorists when you compare them with generally accepted terror groups that have been classified terrorists like qaeda ltte etc ,1
not terrorist group per but the style splc classification they would classified certainly some sort hate supremacist group but the problem with rss isn that was the same problem with gandhi family during upa imo they are bunch unelected extraconstitutional figures who wield enormous influence elected government policies and actions which should not happen democracy ,-1

strikes wickedly obtuse language “pre emptive nonmilitary strikes” and the giddily compliant news media were told official sources that more than 300 militants had been killed security analysts india credited the airstrikes with destroying the illusion that nuclear deterrence can keep india from hitting terrorist infrastructure inside pakistan but modi’ plan didn’ intended independent reporting showed that the indian jets had hit some trees field — and not much else the next morning pakistani fighter jets dropped some bombs inside indian controlled territory which did damage restored

 some cases may not untouchability where used live earlier school days large part the labor were heavy smokers paan chewers etc incidence also was very high talking about east area due small children the house the utensils were separate that said the cook was lady from the called untouchable classes and she used eat and drink the same utensils ,-1
few people here are commenting that matter preference and yes having separate set utensils can matter preference but the big question here think the why you have fancy set utensils that you use when guests come over can described preference because the why this question would that you don want use fancy plate for your everyday eating and have sometime special for guests but when you keep separate set utensils for your workers maids domestic helps etc can not described preference because the why that question would the underlying belief that they are somehow lower than does anyone here disagree that the reason behind keeping separate plate something different than this someone has also mentioned that they might not comfortable sharing the same utensils fair enough your utensils but tell why you are not comfortable when you say that someone can not sit the same level chair that you and must sit the floor not matter preference when you say that you won eat with certain person that can not matter preference again one can and should able force you eat together with someone that why say the why important you simply don like that person not eating together won shouldn big deal however you won eat together with that person because she belongs different caste that discrimination have not mentioned any caste political party here also not claiming whether not the political party question actually exercises those discriminatory behaviour also not saying anything whether their rival party isn guilty the said behaviour response those people who are dismissing this non issue ,1
 all the people saying have personal stuff just want say its cool with your family having your own preferred utensils and undergarments and stuff maybe you like that little garfield coffee mug you purchased trip and want keep for your personal use has personal value problem with that but why don you people use that fancy cutlery and utensils for your maid which you have reserved for your guests those utensils are not designated certain person family person your house doesn have any personal attachment anyone your household why not give them for use you with random general guests the very fact that you have cheap alternate utensils for maid use signifies your elitist mindset you won give your maid superior even equal value utensils because they are lower stature your mindset that hard truth resulting out thousands years our beliefs not entirely your fault but the fault our environment and society ,1

indeed humiliating enough that third rate failed state managed capture indian pilot and then come out looking like the bigger more magnanimous power releasing him but added that the indian government got caught lying and making shit all our pilots are accounted for and most indian media got caught amplifying them unskeptically this whole thing has been such embarrassment for supposed wannabe world power which ostensibly set out avenge terrorist attack ,1

pulwama attack cannot justified any reasoning whatsoever the people who killed our soldiers should brought justice sad part that the whole incident highlighted how much the bjp trying gain from anti pakisthan sentiment congress also opportunist congress another idiot that cannot anything because they have power left they lost credibility they looted the country for years used think pak media much propaganda driven and encashing general hatred towards india but now see difference between our and their media our soft corner for our brave soldiers has been missused for ages but the picture clear political parties have been using generalised hatred against each other tool and nothing else this has been going for ages and will continue sad see any rational question against bjp claim regarding the strike becomes antinational being leftist etc etc saw news channels asking users not spread abhinandan video because another trick pakistan think because people would praise pak army for being nice ,1

from what heard from sources few days back definitely shot down two planes one their pilots got arrested almost immediately and was subsequently shown proof abhinand hadn been shown then india would have said there causality was also told that the helicopter crash india was not crash but was shot down well but not too certain about that basically everyone usa israel india scratching their heads right now said india can retaliate after pulwama giving india the guts strike although think did not anticipate this but india did cross loc with aircraft which was far bigger blunder than intelligence failure that caused pulwama the first place that automatically means pakistan could also strike back especially imran specifically said will retaliate before all this now india had struck our f16 surely would have been photographed now instead are still chasing this second aircraft just don want this become another thing disagree upon pakistan should wait for things settle down tensions are still very high among the ranks and later should reveal full details letting the public speculate about for too long will only cause more harm than good ,1

 was congress very late the social media game since 2014 bjp currently enjoys enormous dominance over social media narrative right now this changing how are you trying change how you plan combat the religious far right narrative social media bjp social media driven mostly either relgious far right hatred modi personality beyond social media how you plan combat hate politics rahul gandhi image has been painted succesfully bjp enormously negative and incompetent even not based reality how are you guys managing combat that for example rahul made many speeches many think tanks those speeches are not spread lot the social media team like this one found this chance when was searching for specific speeches and topics this hasn been publicized lot nationalism you think congress leaders should talk agressively pakistani deep state sponsorship terror know the views manish tewari surjewala because searched the statements their leaders but problem visibility this should repeated again and again their statements are not getting enough limelight nationalism rahul gandhi has indeed praised the iaf strikes and others which the positive step but after that the fog war bjp makes unsubtantiated statement 400 dead random congress leaders questions bjp brands you anti national equating questioning this questioning the indian air force bjp indeed dangerously politicizing the airstrikes but congress falling into the trap taking their bait seems congress falling into the bait bjp most common people not really care about minute details spice 2000 spice 250 most people don care the narrative what congress losing domestic politics international media doesn fight elections here what you think omar abdullah advice the opposition the more you talk about economy and jobs less you have talk about anti national national the opposition parties need switch tracks deny the the space politicise the recent terror attack air strikes the way keep the messaging focused the economy rural distress unemployment agriculture all the other things bjp doesn’ want discussed every time talk about pulwama balakote leave the door wide open for the the bjp play their strengths front their home audience logic would dictate switch strategies make them play our strengths now here another article omar retweeted which says modi has failed many issues but winning the narrative falling into every trap modi setting for them 2004013 some food for thought what you think the ideal way approach this congress willing shift tracks omar put the mahagatbandhan what congress strategy creating narrative for the party the opposition here seems bjp tying more alliances from shiv sena aiadmk for simply boils down two things either there prepoll alliance there not there will come under upa there not then possible that there will post poll alliance then why the need campaign together and the same stage you don put common candidate from each constituency the opposition mega rallies seem only benefit non congress parties the called mahaghatbandan the grand alliance really that much different from nda upa can congress clarify approach alliances modi creating simply narrative you are with you are with khichdi what congress simple message 2014 and rethinking rahul gandhi had said that congress leaders had gotten arrogant the end years upa which was one cause the downfall congress how does the congress message look back upa you say openly you made mistakes but the party has moved improved itself introspected the faults have you thought new name for alliance you win like replacement upa mark symbolic new beginning twitter there lot hate speech and fake news twitter bjp parlimaentary leaders summoned jack dorsey after twitter india suspended hate speech peddler squintneon abvp member from assam who posted posts mocking and celebrating the death dalit student rohith vermula his account was then promoted smiti irani twitter panelists are invited will congress able highlight the core cause this twitter hoopla bigot from abvp mocking suicide and being supported smiriti irani congress should publicize this direct support for this man parliament should also ask about twitter handling rampant fake news and hate speech twitter bjp again created the narrative jack dorsey snubs india based this one temperoriliy deletion hate speech supporter congress should highlight this incident bjp trying appropriate ambedkar and talk dailt rights but leaders are supporting such hatemongerers but twitter narrative jack dorsey who personally doesn know much sweeping this under the rug that know very long questions but these are important topics and congress would benefit from this discussion takes the right lessons ,1

politicians have press conferences gain visibility and make themselves popular answering questions and disseminating information are secondary and the media gets trps return press conferences the serve real purpose that official documents and press briefings ministers and bureaucrats cannot serve not having press conferences given modi doesn mean that there slide towards dictatorship this just reflects the fact that traditional media doesn play big role used and gets elected just reinforce that ,1

 think the saddest part india two party country and such stupid policies will made other parties too can and probably should vote out bjp but what cost congress led alliance will maybe take some populist methods early get approval from the people but will still led leaders who care firstly about themselves next for their family and friends and never about the country its people what the solution more politically active india the cusp great intellectual revolution can make all the jokes about superpower 2020 thing but are going superpower very soon the youth the country very powerful thing high time take more active role how our country governed ,1

 like see the videos ravish blasting the congress with the same effort that puts for the bjp have expected these videos part your post the first place educated people say that anti bjp because that exactly the thing seems have been doing these last years for all the ranting that happening the media for one happy acknowledge that the last years have been relatively peaceful the country have not had any large communal flare there have been small incidents but they have been quelled pretty quickly ,1
when people have too many options choose from they will always fall into their eco chambers that’ how human psyche works all see happening around people from same language state country banding together nobody wants feel uncomfortable any pov against own makes uncomfortable resist and sometimes retaliate against media here make money they will pander people they want target most the media has taken the extremes issues they think they can milk ndtv and ravish target the people who are moderates moderates love the eco chamber ndtv bjp modi nationalist hindutva etc have plenty eco chambers congress rahul tmc etc got their own everyone has the freedom chose their news source and freedom criticize others the problem none are ready listen and think anything outside their comfort zone this problem with all humans irrespective the country you are ,1
that really depends how one perceives journalists and their duty ideally the field demands neutrality not neutral journalist has very visible set thoughts opinions ideology his own neutrality not limited not favoring particular party alone also means that you yourself shouldn lean towards ideology left the centre journalist which makes little more critical bjp compared congress that doesn necessarily makes him bad journalist but can safely say far from being the best one that being said think one can find better journalists print media the constraints maintaining viewership really hampers the way you can conduct news and its contents ,1
people did not realise that always been critical and edgy doesn matter who the power one the best journalist have seen ages ,1

 need make moral policing surveillance election issue… the india that was taught growing was considered diverse pluralistic democracy that allows for freedoms identity and expression yet utterly shameful that the political parties begging for our votes either don bother about our ability and freedom express ourselves worse trample upon them with impunity this starts with beef and then porn and then discussion sites like reddit and goes even the games you play your mobile phone seems like indian culture mainly other people telling you how live your life and there room for people disagree with them everyone needs live this nice sanskari life where the sanskars are just what they consider right and any other kind life will not allowed the worst part have election coming less than month two and issues like our social rights and freedoms aren even being taken that seriously are democracy with population largely under and the youth wings these political parties have severe disconnect from reality evident from the ramya ama last week the bjp obviously doesn give shit about your social issues and the opposition parties don seem care either this probably because they are focused farmer votes and subsidies and concessions need show these political parties that there large substantial urban population that extremely unhappy with their moral policing and daddy state surveillance strategies how many times have read bunch people getting arrested for things they said facebook whatsapp elsewhere and ignored have gotten used and are okay with this happening ,1

 for instance prime minister narendra modi suddenly short circuited the 126 fighter negotiation with dassault and announced the fighter deal without his own defence minister knowing about the time this lie has been repeated again and again but that won make true the original mmrca had several issues including but not limited dassault not agreeing provide warranty for jets made hal and hal man hours requirement making eurofighter bid the cheapest instead dassault from the cag report for the calculation the cost production the aircraft india hal under tot the rfp required the vendors quote the man hours required for production india eads quoted man hour requirement million man hours while quoted million man hours but its bid had stated that these man hours were according the french industry this was not accordance with the rfp which required the vendor quote the man hours required india the time bench marking june 2011 hal had stated that the french man hours had converted indian man hours multiplying das quoted man hours factor but cnc ignored this factor while determining the benchmark price well the vendor this created difficulties later during negotiations with when the cnc realized that after applying the factor the manpower cost was longer the vendor the rfp also stated that the vendor shall guaranty the performance the product design specification the production agency customer locations during cnc took the position that the firm was only responsible for delivery direct flyway aircraft ckd skd and kits and weapons and associated supply and services hal the production agency was responsible for the quality the 108 aircraft manufactured under tot cnc insisted that should take full responsibility for the quality and performance all 126 aircraft required under the rfp the congress likes quote 2014 agreement between hal and dassault portray that this issue was resolved but the disagreement was between contract negotiation committee ministry defence and dassault not hal and dassault the cag report also demolishes that false claim the above two issues led stalemate negotiations five years after the bid and after three years evaluation and negotiations there was finalisation ,1

the article author does bring out some points which are pertinent although not for the same reason the author must have intended democracy what matters most win votes how one party candidate achieves that irrelevant ideally people must vote for candidate after researching his her views opinions background history etc ideally candidate must around informing people what she will elected what his her opinions are various issues ideally media should act behalf the people actively posing the candidate pertinent questions that people themselves would have liked ask him her media should analyse the candidate views opinions and actions educate and empower the people act wisely however are far from the ideal the one hand have people being swayed propaganda demagoguery and populism the other have media actively facilitating empowering and educating the politician out power instead the people such world politician can away with any non stipulatory practices where the dangers his her real face being revealed real instead she employs spin doctors press conferences town hall meets one one interviews one one interaction with people are ideal practices but people vote irrespective whether one practices them not politician wouldn want risk practicing like passing exam not mandatory the next class why take all rahul gandhi has started practice doing all this for this election because has very less baggage has relatively clean image wins this election and form govt seen whether will have the same alacrity when running for his second term ,1

well according bhakths anyone who doesnt subscribe their far right ideology commie ,1
left wing and right wing are terms coined during the french revolution fundamentally what left means the political ideology social equality opposed the social hierarchy which the right wing ideology the term came about because the seating arrangement french parliament which the left side opposed the monarchy and the right side was occupied the monarchy and its supporters people are partly right saying that congress left center because fundamentally opposed social hierarchy but not the extent that ultra leftist and this was inherent during the freedom movement the people who call congress left are not the pseudo intellectuals there merit calling them that anyone who says left means communism nothing more than idiot maoism marxism leninism are all different variations left ideologies with varying degrees also just because someone says they are left doesn mean they are against capitalism for example left but support capitalism with regulation the words don mean anything different and should not mean anything different the indian context well anyone thinks that they are the pseudo intellectuals ,1
leftists are those who are concerned with communism and equality generally they demand for change societies and they are generally liberals cpi extreme left leftists not support capitalistic ideologies ,-1
well many people use these words differently you right the traditional left used refer the self named communist parties even the west you have centre left and more left wing parties although you don have too many communist parties congress centrist centre left party india unique country and the trends will not exactly equal but you could find some similarities with different parties parties make have some leftist policies and some rightwing policies terms economics terms economics very mixed bag you have different different specific policies and implementation that each party cpm has minimal presence india today they used dominant three states tripura kerala and west bengal now they are power only one kerala with bleak prospects ever winning any other state communist parties are called communist but their actual policies vary and depend the state and the leader all three communist ruled states had different policies ,1
 don know much about politics and all but when hear left party associate with the communist party their alliances but curious after reading this post searched about and found that party called left the party which strives hard for the betterment the masses and the down trodden and the party which does not compromise with its basic tenets like establishment egalitarian society and whose cadre are ready sacrifice their lives for that noble cause establish heaven the earth the class less society through democratic means this definition may change from person because different people have different opinions ,1

your occupation promotes others delight sensory gratification there text called the sutta the bamboo acrobat talaputa sutta which discusses performance arts nowhere else stated this wrong livelihood but the buddha does make clear that anyone believes their destination heavenly realm for such occupation then their destination actually hell some have interpreted this suggest performance art general wrong livelihood but that never been specified elsewhere only that performance artists are aware that the work unskillful that recognition mindful what you are stimulating others should enough mitigate the worst the karma when conditions are more suitable for you would ideal move into more wholesome line work until conditions are better for though simply mindful and cultivate your practice the best your ability given the conditions you have been dealt ,1
due your situation you have work such way many buddhists women buddhist countries have deal with life too yet everyone can live the five precepts and the knowledge impermanence suffering and non self this knowledge useful contemplate the very nature the five aggregates whatever occupation you have you can practice the methods suitable for the situation from insight can developed ancient buddhist tradition such women were not condemned only bad conducts that are opposed the precepts were not appreciated everyone supposed become more and more mature though remarkable story happened during emperor asoka time once arrived ganges river happened that prostitute was able make river flow upward when she uttered the truth her being living the five precepts perfection don fully remember this story whoever heard this story before can explain ,1

 genuinely feel that the patriot act one the best shows its kind recent times enjoyed lot the episodes while also felt some the other episodes lacked the same quality this episode left slightly disappointed say the least brought lot important and relevant points against the and bjp but seemingly ignored the positive changes brought about since 2014 moreover merely glanced over the shortcomings rahul gandhi and the inc not even minutes the episode was about why bjp actually had overwhelming victory 2014 nothing about the sheer incompetence rahul gandhi actually considered candidate this episode was exactly what outsider would assume about india using the fractional information obtained through social media ,1

over stuffed episode went through too many topics demonetization religious extremism and just didn have time them justice ,1
loved the episode been watching the series since the beginning and this was far the best one because something you know close his personal experiences well obviously was critical more the bjp being the ruling party but also highlighted the deficiencies the congress also kudos tharoor for coming even though knew would lampooned and the sunanda pushkar case brought again ,1

just watched decent think there were lot topics cover and not enough time tried keep impartial slightly anti bjp possible without making too many controversial statements mostly sounds like quick summary recent indian political atmosphere for non indians and nris was also smart enough have tiptoed around the kashmir topic with restricting his comments the pulwama attacks and airstrikes think that was wise both for his and netflix sake ,1

appreciating good work regardless political parties what everyone should ,1

thanissaro bhikkhu “ all know what happens when fire goes out the flames die down and the fire gone for good when first learn that the name for the goal buddhist practice nibbana nirvana literally means the extinguishing fire hard imagine deadlier image for spiritual goal utter annihilation turns out though that this reading the concept mistake translation not much word image what did extinguished fire represent the indians the buddha day anything but annihilation according the ancient brahmans when fire was extinguished went into state latency rather than ceasing exist became dormant and that state — unbound from any particular fuel — became diffused throughout the cosmos when the buddha used the image explain nibbana the indian brahmans his day bypassed the question whether extinguished fire continues exist not and focused instead the impossibility defining fire that doesn burn thus his statement that the person who has gone totally out can described however when teaching his own disciples the buddha used nibbana more image freedom apparently all indians the time saw burning fire agitated dependent and trapped both clinging and being stuck its fuel burned ignite fire one had seize when fire let its fuel was freed released from its agitation dependence and entrapment — calm and unconfined this why pali poetry repeatedly uses the image extinguished fire metaphor for freedom fact this metaphor part pattern fire imagery that involves two other related terms well upadana clinging also refers the sustenance fire takes from its fuel khandha means not only one the five heaps form feeling perception thought processes and consciousness that define all conditioned experience but also the trunk tree just fire goes out when stops clinging and taking sustenance from wood the mind freed when stops clinging the khandhas thus the image underlying nibbana one freedom the pali commentaries support this point tracing the word nibbana its verbal root which means unbinding what kind unbinding the texts describe two levels one the unbinding this lifetime symbolized fire that has gone out but whose embers are still warm this stands for the enlightened arahant who conscious sights and sounds sensitive pleasure and pain but freed from passion aversion and delusion the second level unbinding symbolized fire totally out that its embers have grown cold what the arahant experiences after this life all input from the senses cools away and she totally freed from even the subtlest stresses and limitations existence space and time the buddha insists that this level indescribable even terms existence nonexistence because words work only for things that have limits all really says about — apart from images and metaphors — that one can have foretastes the experience this lifetime and that the ultimate happiness something truly worth knowing the next time you watch fire going out see not case annihilation but lesson how freedom found letting ” html,1
 buddhism are taught that once arahantship attained and have reached nibbana the cycle samsara broken and arahant vanishs just like flame the concept flame ancient india differnt than the common modern conception based this arhant aware and conscious after death the question not applicable surely better stuck samara where get experience positive experiences well negative any experience better than none what ever this the clinging and thirsting referred the second noble truth what you precieve better the cause dukkha ,1

 you still householder lay person but according the website literature somehow equal the bhikkus and bhikkunis can you provide some context here lay ordination the order interbeing just begins with the five precepts which has been rebranded the five mindfulness trainings not sure what that supposed mean eventually you work taking the bodhisattva precepts which our tradition based the upasakasila sutra involving six major precepts and minor precepts the site describes taking days mindfulness per year what those days look like entail this probably reference uposatha observance guess here that divided into days month around the full moon and new moon lineage does days month plus holidays which probably comes out days well basically what the value lay ordination being normal householder fully ordained monk normal householder has not taken ordination the precepts and likely has only taken the three refuges that all not quite sure what you asking here about value though ordained laity have personal relationship with their preceptor who may may not their master and have begun the zen path earnest those who only taken the three refuges are still the stage cultivating merit and their practice most likely falls primarily the devotional side also primarily theravada practitioner would find the teachings thay zen lineage compatible would they allow continue studying from theravadan perspective tremendous deal vietnamese thien based the contents the pali nikayas chinese agamas and commentarial works early sravakayana teachers like shigao far contemporary mahayana goes think likely the most sravayana set lineages most laity will never even approach the more traditional chan style teachings they are typically reserved for monastics very advanced lay disciples the bulk practice particularly for laity with sravakayana methods either mindfulness breath mindfulness buddha with the intent progressing through the dhyanas into samadhi thien dinh sometims called stillness english not sure what tnh lineage calls colloquially english edit should point out that the order interbeing broader than just tnh lineage now many different but related vietnamese thien lineages have coalesced into the order including own pure land thien lineage but far know they are all lieu quan thien ,1

because good administrator compared others have all the skill required for being good politician have good speaking and manipulating skills hardworking talks what people wants hear moreover there large proportion indian voters that are nationalists supporting right wing for them specially modi hero other called right wing leader can match his chrisma currently except yogi aditynath maybe third other opposition leader good politician narendra modi specifically rahul seems forced politics don think have any interest politics whatsoever all talks are freebies like women reservation loan waiver farm subsidies etc,1

 get this article sanders campaign stat case for reparations included disadvantaged white 1790876391 you really want reparations you approach them way that brings people together whether you agree with that not you have concede sanders good company ,1
the fact that they keep asking him why needs run should convince you that does need run wasn threat the establishment would not questioned more and more someone correct wrong but never heard anyone ever ask another candidate why they needed run and funny because 2016 most republican candidates had very similar platform biden joining the race white old men love see npr ask him why needs run has about other candidates who are running moderate platform ,1
let bernie bernie ,0
their coverage 2016 bernie was terrible they were the hillary camp quickly the 500 superdelegates were least they still lean liberal ,-1
there are other places electioneering propaganda lets keep reddit for stuff that worth reading about ,1
certain candidates bernie and tulsi are the most prominent this regard are going get the questions intended discredit them can stop just push through,1
its just that common india audience fed with all propaganda about modi like how works for hrs day etc and this their first time internet and they literally believe truth they are under the impression that the political posters about modi etc are all true and since these involve him giving strong poses which show him authority they believe that strong hard working leader they have hard time understanding that these posters are made from the cell and meant show modi favorable light ,1
obviously ignores the anti hindu casteist divide and rule strategy the congress which gives fuel and allows people secessionists india hassan doesn’ know shit about india and makes the obvious “muh minority persecution” excuse maybe they got their act together they wouldn’ persecuted the scale they currently are doesn’ know ignores shit about congress just like lot the leftist indians stuff like rabid conversions the south “ram mythological character” casteist politics etc all get ignored stuff like bjp doing more for muslim women’ rights and education than congress also ignored ,0
 you read the complete quote what she saying that farmer said \ ,1
amusing but one sided hassan you are not fooling anyone ,1
what popular not always right ,1
 how the fuck popular even after fucking many major policy decisions even when sorta communal and seems erode democracy practices that where you are wrong bro lot people support him precisely because communal that and the propaganda you don need find complicated explanation something simple ,1
lol few decades people will look during this decade with the same sort disbelief and pity reserved for the germans the forties ,1
because internet has gotten cheap and misinformation spreading like wildfire take decade adjust the new normal modi the chetan bhagat politics his only fans are people who only recently come online seasoned bigots digging his own and bjp grave though will down history the worst ,1
 like how earlier bollywood movies raked money selling coolie mard tangey walah ,0
modi moron who has failed every front the kind idiot who thinks building diplomatic ties means has hug every world leader become fraands has understanding economics comes with schemes and yojnas that don really work the real world the basic reason why this failed leader very popular because the majority hindus india especially upper caste educated ones have disliked the minorities for long time and now they have their guy power the feel they have all the power now modi does not inspire confidence leader any reasonable person the man communal idiot who will divide india will get elected again for personally even rahul inspires more confidence despite his inexperience because isn bad person modi ,-1
’ nearing john oliver’ level with some these and indian guy holy cow this was accurate ,1
what find absolutely unbelievable that centrist outlets are now cynically trying pretend that there any support whatsoever for reparations any mainstream political circles all means npr cnn msnbc the dnc the dccc etc want start bandwaggoning cynically for reparations for the descendants slaves please make fucking happen but what unbelievably ironic that they are the ones standing the way being politically feasible feel like taking fucking crazy pills ,-1

 watched the episode and panned out exactly like thought would didn expect anything less from hasan who regularly panders the left the comparison modi and trump was laughable best was obvious attempt demonize modi but doesn actually talk about what modi has done for the welfare india don understand why leftists america have demonize right wing parties india could have talked about how all the other options are pathetic and talked though bjp has falsely labelled rahul but really rahul has brought about his own downfall doing stupid things overall very superficial and left leaning episode ,-1

 really don think either these questions unfair they both great opportunities for sanders make the case for himself sanders ran 2016 the assertion that was the only candidate who was pushing for single payer system living wages intense program for climate action etc was compelling argument and ’ certainly why supported him that definitely not the case this time around and that large part thanks bernie pushing the envelope but does mean that got make the case now that the best candidate achieve those goals happen think uses the question opportunity stake his claim ’ going tackle the issue grassroots movement builder rather than policy wonk aiming for middle ground that coupled with consistent record what makes him stand out says much what’ the issue trying say reparations has only become issue “ easy talking point discredit sanders ” actually disingenuous reporters like astead wesley have been asking candidates about the issue since before sanders announced ’ become issue because activists have made issue should know where candidates stand “forcing” candidate clarify their positions good thing the african american community supposed scrutinize sanders’ position someone has ask him the question can’ continue say “actually the young white berniebro story myth and our community cares about these minority issues” and then get defiant when someone asks question about minority issue those issues are only brought way attack our guy there are plenty reasons critical 2020 reporting but really don’ think questions like this are ,1

director small software product private limited company here since the birdbrain modi has come into power implemented gst with little clarity many things and tons paperwork the service tax system was much more clearer and simpler gst joke exports are 100 tax free and they still are but now have submit bond every year tying significant percentage revenue low interest bank has made effort rein angel tax taxing all investments venture capitalists income made many payment restrictions indian credit card processors that have use foreign processor which charges very high commission and bank transfer fees then decided that can use foreign processors charge indian cards had split the billing software product into two different systems and its mess and now this selfie thing its waste time and money especially the registered address not the same address the one work from its residential address gotta get board and put and wondering how the fuck does this help detect illegitimate businesses modi fucking moron every decision that makes like demonitization just wakes farts gets idea and implements without any consultantion research logical thinking ,1
before the 2014 elections modi used say paraphrasing don any work just have people doing the work for table usually empty and just coordinate between them think passed down these kinds thoughts his underlings the centre well the idea has been push all the work the people and the businesses instead doing anything substantial crack down illegal things the way gst works right now makes impossible 100 compliant anyway customers don know the rules and tbh with many changes every now and then neither and they expect flexible with them even means not complying with the law the b2b space that just means death the business also people who think trading not legitimate business should understand how actually works and benefits the market before making stupid comments against the baniyas running such smes lots manufacturers don like selling b2c because increases the hassle dealing with customers they are not equipped deal with and because they directly own their production units which have run regular basis they want minimum order quantity which small retail establishment small multi brand outlet home business side income for housewives usually run people who are transacting well below the purview almost all regulatory compliances cannot possibly achieve they rely b2b wholesale businesses bring about the volumes needed even brands with name recognition like blackberry oxemberg and jack jones this last one surprised too when heard about run separate distribution large mbo division drive the volumes whether old stock not immaterial they need b2b sell large quantities the way this government has gone about things they want either fuck over our customers they don follow the rules are expected follow even though they are not required they know still vote for them apparently because the community generally anti muslim and fear mongering and chest thumping are easy way keep distracted from the real problems hand mean they successfully cultivated the narrative over the past two decades that the muslim population percentage grows too much they will want the imposition sharia first for their own community and later for the population large that why they will get away with this shit ,1

thiruvananthapuram and think sashi takes this time there ain modi wave and kummanam rajagopal think they fielded the worse possible candidate they could was enjoying nice retirement job manipur and they dragged him outta there trivandrum the bjp strongest constituency and they should have gone with ulli sura but they fricking fight much within the party that they would basically ensured sura doesn get his name anywhere near the ballot box ,1
trivandrum tharoor will win kummanam will come second divakaran probably the best party candidate cpi could muster but going lose badly lot left supporters the last two elections voted for tharoor 2009 and split between tharoor and rajagopal 2014 specifically because cpi candidate and the other candidates were heavyweights tharoor should get better margin this time the nadar vote that was split last time with bennet abraham should come back him rajagopal lost last time despite coming top five assembly constituencies because fell the third place the coastal nadar belt attingal sampath most likely win though the margin might reduce extremely popular politician across party lines congress has chance only the bjp candidate overperforms and takes vote from ldf which quite unlikely ,1

absolutely true there are few more things that should included when looking his appeal firstly his strongman image india and also worldwide there trend towards people who make brash provocative statements being seen strong leaders trump for instance considered his supporters stronger leader than obama though the latter actually carried out more deportations and got osama killed modi takes step further and combines with bold not necessarily good initiatives like demo and the recent air strikes against pakistan now well known that demo was complete failure and what the air strikes actually achieved terms strategic objectives unclear best but from political perspective country like india these are brilliant moves after demo people were saying idea was good only implementation was bad though implementation optional component the govt responsibilities and not the most important component course the idea itself was insane but let not there this has led the least doing something syndrome despite the fact that previous govts also have done something yet that perception has been created and modi excellent spotting this key differentiator that why the govt keeps harping about nehru and other past and dead pms that why every bjp shill keeps parroting the white lie that nothing happened years combine that with the notion that everything the has done historic even when essentially rebranded existing initiatives but his greatest trump card was and will always rahul gandhi not only because that man walking gaffe machine fair modi but modi has carefully created media network that will suppress this fact the real problem with raga and his sister they are boy scout politicians raga seems have forgotten that the three state elections were not the thumping inc victories that were expected the inc won them very narrowly all modi needed turn the tide was major national crisis modi being political genius quickly seized upon pulwama even person who intensely dislikes modi and extremely skeptical his handling pulwama cannot imagine raga handling any better than modi finally has said that the alternatives are not very promising raga shitshow mamata the next most likely candidate just fascist and authoritarian modi not more most the opposition alliances only exist beat modi that the only glue holding these rivals together should they succeed that glue will dissolve and most people know this ,1

 academia most are brainwashed urban naxal and anything even remotely positive about modi gets the response what are you kidding you support modi reeeeeeee they react some uneducated communal bigoted person mocked and most them come from educated families while the ones coming from average not intellectual family support modi the called intellectuals are modi hater and average indian supports modi have had conversation with cab driver kolkata young guy almost age who wanted join army but cudnt because family needed him work asked you support modi said yes was sooooo happy said most people who are patriotic support modi also going vote for him airport two security guards were talking the elder one who was about retire was painting modi someone scary bloodthirsty and saying won elected again the younger guy was while being respectful was still trying support modi saying that isn that bad and think will come back etc family close friends are modi supporter anyway sum the intellectuals hate modi and consider anyone supporting for modi bigoted person the older generation also less likely support modi the average indian young indian like support modi think leftist wave limited the internet intellectuals only edit also circle mostly the intellectuals who are outspoken and discuss politics while modi supporters mostly remain quite after election dates were announced guy who wants kashmir separated from india and thinks phulwama was result what indian army has done kashmiris was loudly saying how modi has made south indian states have single phase larping some conspiracy theories his neutral friends was soo hilarious asked him any chance whatsapp forward that you took bit too seriously ,1
 sometimes think randians are indian not and why they sound like pakistani ,1
randians are right about everything they think about india they should realise that india has had several decades left wing government and now may the time for the right wing rule least for one more term don’ expect miracles but even bjp shows that they have proper vision how fix all the issues may they should stick around for couple more terms ,1

 2002 narendra modi the current india and then rss hardliner mismanaged riot and turned into state sponsored pogrom gave the rioters free hand and several his mlas and ministers were convicted rioting instigating the riots and giving the rioters list muslim owned houses was investigated special investigation team sit report exonerates modi the highlights 473243 html appointed the supreme court india under congress government and cleared all guilt another court later upheld this verdict one major reason lost was the fact that was deemed too moderate and ‘anti hindu’ while this probably some the reason lost should mentioned here that the results were total surprise everyone and contradicted the polls quite bit one the hindu right going vote for congress and turnout was still somewhat high though modi had campaigned these things and tried more moderate and economic focused the first few years lost track far all the major policies under him have either been economic foreign policy related the only major social policies under him have been letting the court making rulings social policy without interference homosexuality triple talaq and repealing the hajj subsidy due rise right wing nationalism there were multiple lynchings muslims which modi was silent the cow lynchings part absolutely true they have risen since got elected however modi has condemned lynchings indias modi condemns violence name cow worship iduskbn19k13s though criticizing him the speed his response valid point fake news say hasn condemned the government also demonetized the economy late 2016 win elections don think was win and haven really heard that until now the government claims have done for variety reasons overall the effects seem the government has failed its objective make harder launder money demonetization caused significant dip gdp growth the objective reduce terrorism was achieved naxalite communist terrorists were forced surrender masse some areas though whether this trend has sustained debated addition tax collection increased and continuing the increase the party currently using terrorist attacks for political gains they responded terror attack likely backed pakistan attacking terrorists they have done this twice the first which confirmed video while the second which contested idea how striking back can construed some sort exploitation event congress party has some nutty policies they barely have policies the bjp stands for something while the congress stands for getting the congress power the party has been ruled historically corrupt political dynasty for bit now and functions making populist promises well appealing certain demographics usually their winning coalition consists minority religions which why they blocked shah bano certain castes hindus and any farmers they can win over they usually will propose some sort pro farmer policies right now they playing the role opposition party fairly well but almost too well they just contradicted everything the bjp has said without offering too much platform past pure populism there couple people who are actual true heart congress believers but for most people matter substance and some corruption better worse than hindu nationalism these parties want wreck the indian economy and are supported ‘economists’ from leftist indian universities while this absolutely true throw the commies bone here like the bjp and unlike the congress they actually stand for something and are fairly noncorrupt they been ruling the state kerala for while now and the state has some really really good indicators good fact one the few examples communists can point when asked about the success communism don really have responses past this point just expressing thoughts individual parties tmc this one more just ranting than actual response mamata herself congress the extreme while congress this election has been adopting soft hindutva which basically translates visiting temples mamata has like said been accused various anti hindu things not mention outright forbidding processions for fairly important hindu holiday allow muslim holiday continue without fear violence bahujan samaj party takes advantage casteist feelings the extreme indian politics identity politics the bjp tries make blocs vote religion and congress does caste whoever wins the lower caste hindu like india white working class swing vote vote wins the election bsp caste based politics turned party for low castes precipitated giving low castes more power for those you who don know india has what republicans think affirmative action the states namely they reserve certain number seats colleges and government jobs for minorities and more importantly historically underpriviledged castes now you get situations where historically privileged castes vote blocs get reservation status and certain castes are thrown under the bus they were historically priv but don have enough numbers significant voting bloc and ofc mayawatis solution give upper castes cms reservation too ncp ncp the nationalist congress party like the congress ncp also social democratic but also appeals indian civic nationalism the party opposed sonia gandhi being congress leader the party opposes indian citizens ‘unnatural’ origins from holding public offices that why was created sonia longer leader and they just usually form coalition with congress they probably close the center but still secular shiv sena you hit this one pretty much right the nail also like say the gujurat riots the one modi was blamed for prompted the leader the shiv sena call muslims cancer aam admi party along with bjp congress and left this the only party with national name recognition lol they literally confined delhi and like other states where they have legislative presence basically delhi aap just talked lot about because indian liberals love and the idea also the left doesn have ton real presence either they have about seats the lok sabha combined tdp this one fairly accurate and pretty sad honest the direction the party pretty free floating andhra needs some development after losing hyderabad aimim– aimim the islamic equivalent the bjp seeks establish islamic democracy india and often resorts hate based rhetoric like advocating genocide more like the islamic equivalent the shiv sena also they only somewhat relevant their home state telangana they have exactly one seat the lok sabha,1

can another country influence the outcome democratic election esp successful democracy russians probably did most recently and fear pakistan has also done well you see before pulwama things were falling place people started talking about issues bjp was backfoot and seemed that change will happen and bjp will shown its place but after pulwama and balakot things changed abruptly and now seems modi will most probably win another term not forget the absolute ineptness and infighting the opposition helped great deal the bjp now call conspiracy theorist you want but cant help but wonder that did pakistan pulloff the greatest con job the democratic world post cold war ,1

 the prime minister imposing mediocrity sophisticated country holyshit color impressed with statement ,1
 unsparing his assault modi rahul also wondered whether the prime minister ever studied university and alleged educational institutions were undergoing saffronisation under his watch modi has reduced the prime minister office the status publicity minister office busy marketing himself earlier said still have access his university degree nobody actually knows went university not there rti application delhi seeking degree but has not been responded gandhi said adding the prime minister imposing mediocrity sophisticated country ,1

atrocious,-1
such things are best addressed opposition parties when they are all keeping silent for reasons best known only them don think there anything people can whole none the opposition parties seem have much enthusiasm for anything nowadays also large section society malleable that can get influenced mediocre actors into following drama peddling pied piper doom then means laws and institutions stopped mattering them long ago ,1
well can argue from freedom speech perspective,0
 didn’ know who modi was 2014 remember watching election results with friends and people around were excited one guy explained all why modi was the best choice for arnab shouted enthusiastically and everything seemed merry brushed off allegations against him stories opposition one colleagues who against modi started discussing modi and first defended him after all did put good show first years rolled got harder and harder defend this guy stopped discussing politics with colleague because doesn’ really suit work environment but didn’ need those discussions clearly see what was wrong with modi beliefs were strongly shaken when allowed people like yogi come power and the agenda shifted from development and setting institutions setting cow sheds started watching stand comedy youtube and other interviews like shut kunal and the reasoning “anti nationals” started making sense more and more every single allegation whether crony capitalism fostering hostile communal environment has come true may have done some good for the country but the bad definitely outweighs the good this not progressive candidate for would truly disastrous another years with the way things are going ,1

the title click bait best india not bruised idea india has well established constitution laws regulations and the necessary institutions back which are run competent people for the most part very few countries has this and india has been able grow into mature democracy yes modi has stirred religious right wingers and lot things has done supports determinantl society whole yes congress has done its part appease lot religious groups communities get votes not trying down play any damage any shity has done the past but one two shitty are not going any damages that irreversible the biggest thing understand here that the democratic process india works for the most part when there political will the right thing things get done real quick aap delhi good example aap has the ability what has done because the necessary departments institutions laws etc are place this took decades built the other day saw one police officer from the motor vehicle department single handily clear major traffic block made over 200 vehicles all sizes less than mins did this while pulling aside the truck driver who caused the block pulling his vehicle documents and his drivers licence have liberal governments being voted out for right wing government who also has the ability voted out and vice versa has happened before and will happen again most importantly the coming generation care less for religious bullshit politics ,1
the idea india overrated congress being decimated because they centralized power diverse country like india should and can only thrive decentralized polity but the hindustani has viewed every other linguistic and ethnic group with suspicion and result today consumed the communal schism partition that never addressed honest manner long the indian identity centered around the hindustani will always weak and pathetic idea ,-1
 don support modi and wouldn like bjp come back power but don think are left with much choice here rahul gandhi doesn evoke lot confidence prime minister fair his reactions anything far hasn shown him better leader run india also don really believe another modi government will destroy india the current world one government can only slow down the economy the very most not kill fact another term for bjp may force the opposition more organised and understand what the country needs ,1

wanted share conversation had with bro who ostensibly secular closet modi bhakt says supports cos economics policies and then proceeds find some positive with demo also asked him bhai for old times sake don you feel bad about the cow lynching admits considers them his failure not able stop them but these things happened before also also appeasement policy why you feel victimized give one example where muslims get better deal over hindus said temples under govt mosques not said but how does that affect you and give that hurts you said wife doesn get holiday gujju new year but even though only celebrate eid that declared holiday was stunned truly secular brother has turned into closet fanatic past decades terms term propoganda for the curious let tell you his wife works for central govt and hence doesn get state specific holidays face palm moment for itna kachra kaise saaf hoga ,-1

this isn very smart way thinking you have the state elections for the state parties then you may choose what you want however lok sabha elections are for choosing who rules the country the centre even you choose state party the end indeed between modi and rahul gandhi because the state parties will only send support alliance foreign relations defence governmental policy all the items national importance that are the national last under the constitution will dealt with centre fracturing the mandate voting for nondiscript state parties you will waste your vote and disservice the nation don that ,-1
yes will good but also have some negative effect but giving much powers states can lead separation often find india bunch diffrent countries put together keeping the power the central keeps united,1
exactly people think that voting for parties that aap waste time even you identify with their agenda because will probably never win majority that not the point indian elections aap going join some coalition anyway the point give the party you identify with power the centre chair the table that your demands are heard and enforced with threats leaving the coalition that how power works indian imo ,-1

 while the party has done good empower marginalized communities has idiotic policies like jobs reserved private sectors the bsp basically the dalit party and reservation affirmative action the dalit community somewhat analogous the black community the usa and mlk was inspired ambedkar who created the indian constitution concept reservation worth noting that reservation was not implemented properly until the early nineties which when the liberalization the indian economy began and the public sector began shrink imo entirely reasonable have reservation the private sector the public sector slowly privatized atleast until the dalits reach and maintain proportional representation all levels ,1
change view feel left wing congress far more incompetent and harmful india rather than right wing bjp says uniform civil code can implemented bjp calls its progressive 116101300782 html ahmed khan shah bano begum the 1980s the vishva hindu parishad vhp began campaign for the construction temple dedicated rama the site with the bharatiya janata party bjp its political voice the movement was bolstered the decision district judge who ruled 1986 that the gates would reopened and hindus permitted worship there this decision was endorsed indian national congress politician rajiv gandhi then the prime minister india who sought regain support from hindus had lost over the shah bano controversy nonetheless the congress lost the 1989 general election and the bjp strength parliament grew from members making its support crucial the new government singh congress such dogla party even their appeasement they have done nothing substantial for muslims even now they deal issues with equal opportunities poverty living ghettos for the strata which needs the most simple enough point for say why can all agree rules are the same for all residents the country and large and cannot have different laws for different people based what they believe they keep supporting useless policies around religion property laws etc development they absolutely nothing should have progressed lot more from modi campaign which resonated with what did congress give mnerga allowed people dig gaddha look your work place person keeps consistently failing for doing job for years and then after small break year you think that the person will now better job its their dna people have changed the congress party what has anything changed since 2016 ,1

 read answer quora but direct links aren allowed here just paste the answer here though the images the answer are lost also don agree with the answer completely but interesting counterpoint the general viewpoint have about hindutva question why did veer sawarkar form hindu mahasabha was atheist answer culture the physical manifestation individual spiritual immortality humans despite our mortal bodies crude natures flawed minds are luminous beings who can exist for millennia travel across oceans will and speak entire generations once under the right conditions for this one only one condition must met the individual must overcome their delusions mortality instead identify with immortal reality once that done all else follows the primary fallacy the average atheist makes the course their reading their belief that they somehow slipped off the chains religion delusion developed some sort individualistic freedom that nonsense the only thing they done exchange one set chains for another there absolutely difference between the rituals organized religion the flag marches communism for that matter liberal socialism there heaven religious liberal there was never any heaven merely duty never ending thankless duty part unknowing all knowing greater being with sense individual good evil even indifference that what the bhagavad gita actually says that what liberals don understand human beings want have part greater whole this sentiment the very basis humanity its civilizations its ethos religion like all ideologies merely another set lies meant justify the existence yet another unjust exploitative society because all societies their very collective existence are unjust exploitative the individual but that okay because human beings either want exploit exploited themselves even the holy liberals are bound their own set untruths and thus must constantly justifying arguing over group nonentities they not see that their stand absolute knowledge different from that adopted the christians muslims when they were persecuting being persecuted the pagans who preceded them there not single argument liberals have that hasn been raised ten thousand times earlier thomas aquinas lao tzu the buddha himself the mahabharata there not single argument the god delusion that hasn been discussed far more exhaustively dedicatedly comprehensively the tripitakas there isn single criticism the bible that wasn known countered thomas aquinas the individuals concerned thomas aquinas the buddha were not only far more intelligent learned enlightened than your liberal thinks they were all probability some the most intelligent beings grace this species the idea that they were foolish enough fall under some sort superstitious nonsense ridiculous they believe because choose chose order defend our chosen group the virtues sins this group whether this group christians hindus muslims even the people known certain circles sickulars don even figure this equation “for after all how know that two and two make four that the force gravity works that the past unchangeable both the past and the external world exist only the mind and the mind itself controllable – what then ” thus clearly see that the tribe the fundamental necessity well the ultimate goal human existence how this tribe defines itself called culture this culture turn can defined multiple factors race religion the communist manifesto the mein kampf nietzsche the god delusion course organized religion any tribe virtue the numerical superiority philosophical strength provides its members superior any number individuals thus dominates the latter through slaughter plunder therein lies the crux why the three great monotheistic faiths christianity islam judaism have destroyed virtually every single pagan faith the world save for india china paganism simply not robust enough ideology effectively bind people together too individualistic offers too many choices has too many freedoms don mistake freedom for the lack oppression murdering babies though that might been pure roman anti carthiginian propaganda burning widows which was the british digging nearly extinct traditions anti hindu propaganda are oppression but they not connote lack freedom the mere allowing choice within one spiritual thus cultural fabric paganism weakens the tribe thus paves the way for its own demise then why did india china survive the answer simple what the biggest factor that sets india china apart from the world and thus our hordes have given these two civilizations the immortality not even eternal egypt mighty rome could aspire like dragons outfought our pagan foes like monkeys cheated the mongol tumens like rats out bred our civilized monotheist oppressors thus survived but this state affairs could never continued for ever fertility rates fall schools open teach new lies place old ones people their eternal search for suffering hanker after new more horrifying tortures what people forget that leaving their religion they are effectively abandoning their own culture thus the very basis human civilization true they gain better softer society society more amenable individualistic bliss but such state affairs can only temporary before such hedonistic loosely bound members are swept away hard unthinking orthodoxy hindus long protected from the depredations islam christianity their vast population multifarious ethnic divisions warlike nature the early 1900s were open such culturalization thanks several events not under this answer purview thus was evident any well read indian the early 1900s that india concept was doomed extinction all said and done india hindu concept created hindus populated hindus defined hindus don give that secular nonsense hinduism like all indo european faiths does not correlate morality with divinity and thus shows tolerance for other religions unknown any faith currently existing earth yes even buddhism christians would got with their belief mythical jerusalem muslims would gone praying arab stone but india india are neither israel arabia and thus was born hindutva racial pride for made race one believed cultural pride for non existent culture land with millions civilizational pride for civilization that had long passed into legend fallen into barbarism religious pride for made religion that had carved out from the very forces meant oppose what savarkar being atheist real atheist unlike the anti national conformist phonies quora the indian liberals realized was that hinduism was unlikely survive for long merely account being pagan faith and with hinduism would gone the very essence india think yourself there are thousands dance traditions india how many them are islamic origin how many are christian origin how many ragas have the communists authored what good have the hordes the indian media done for humanity after one thousand years what good would bunch shouting news anchors have accomplished and yet play the same raga bhairavi the emperor samudragupta once played his veena thousand years before the first ship sailed around africa the same raga ustad bismillah khan performed every day the ghats varanasi until few years ago thus savarkar remade hinduism from christianity came the purpose violence militaristic organization from islam came the stress ideological purity defensiveness from judaism came the emphasis free enterprise racial religious existence the world oldest religion was reforged the very image the newest order withstand new crueller more ignorant humanity what did was different from what ataturk did when rebuilt new turkey form the ashes the ottoman porte when mao took the most bitter war torn people the world recast them into united china was nationalist everything did was for the nation for posterity judge his actions not but judge his intentions his character judged intellectual pygmies who haven had single original thought their own veer savarkar deserves better ,1

look this way modi better candidate than doubt but there degree sense autocracy his rule sort all his decisions are based his final say without consideration other ministers opinions others are just supposed carry them out least upa wins and becomes will surrounded sensible people like scindia tharoor kharge priyanka gandhi give him sound and informed opinion and that something even mom would consider doing personally though would liked third option something terms mahagathbandhan coalition regional parties unite and stake claim mean sabko saal gandagi saaf karne mauka milna chahiye and agree with watch turtle porn point about the increase internal hatred regarding petty issues which was guess last observed 2002 the representatives the current govt has definitely been instrumental inciting the common people with this feeling religious supremacy ,1

that really welcome post obviously congress gave birth bjp congress has other agenda politics but removing bjp matter what the cost the same goes with bjp father was cpwd and charge maintenance parliamentary building infrastructure was extremely surprised looking parliament canteen where two politicians different parties fighting lok sabha would enjoying their subsidised meals over civil discussion lot congress and bjp are good friends during childhood used believe undertaker and kane were really brothers and now turned bloodthirsty enemies growing realised wwe staged after growing more realised even parliament staged and this not just india this global phenomenon democracy has become cartel like business arrangement now politicians have cracked long ago ,1
 you look closely people who turned ambani daughter wedding congress stalwarts like anand sharma attended this the same congress that leading rafael scam against ambani interest ,0
 sab mile hue hai jokes apart heard rumour which rife the political circles that congress intentionally putting shitshow and refusing share seats with allies even states where weak because desperately wants rahulbaba become 2024 after anti incumbency factor against bjp kicks knows that this year makes deals with allies and somehow the upa manages get comfortable number seats enough form coalition government allies like cbn mamta mayawati kejri and others will not let rahulbaba become hence way conceding defeat with asshole planning way are fucked with bjp without bjp with absolute gutter assholes the helm the two biggest parties ,-1
look their business interests joint foreign trips are another data point even the first level leades fight the second level leaders have common interests mostly financing ,1
this true can confirm you look the candidates nowadays they are clearly not loyal party ideologies the bigwigs have business interests together ranges from mining educational institutions real estate common folk are gullible can constantly make money through their insecurities ,1
mostly true the left and the right are like the yin and yang they are dependant each other justify their existence the sins one side result the rise the other and vice versa for not actually punishing the culprits that political tactic you punish your opponent you create martyr and kill issue which you could have milked for ages ,1

" caligola1987 2016 印度要想威胁中国必须解决以下两点： 种姓制度。这是制约人口素质普遍提升为制造业提供劳动力的决定因素。 政府能顺畅地征地搞基建。制造业不仅仅是制造，造出来了还得便宜地运出去。中国的强大是有配套的公路，，码头各种基建。 第一条不来次问革是解决不了的。第二条也许能解决，但绝对不是ｍｏｄｉ一个人能半得到的。 印度立国后的国际形式比中国好不知道多少倍，七八十年代就被西方看好，大量外资涌入进行基建，结果基本都是悲剧收场。最有名的就是安然的dabhol电站，从建的第一天开始当地的在野党就煽动民众抗议集会说这项目批下来执政党观赏勾结有黑幕。结果呢，印度到现在都没有一个健全的电网，动不动全国性大停电。 印度的民主的制度跟台湾的闹剧差别不大。

" 亦喜亦悲 还真不是yy，我一朋友是船东公司小开，他家的货运单子几年前一天能有二三百单，现在一天最多也就几十单，他家里已经开始让他学印度语了，现在制造业往印度流动的非常明显。 他妈妈有个朋友，以前开鞋厂的，高峰期几千名工人，后来把厂子关了，全家带几个亿搬去加拿大了，像这样的制造业老板非常非常多，场子开的一点意思都没。 我觉得国人应该正视这种威胁，以我所处的角度来看，现在国内的制造业衰败的太吓人了。

people questioning the timing announcement posturing should remember how world locked out nsg india nuclear programme can trace its origins march 1944 and its three stage efforts technology were openly advocating and working the weapons program 1964 bhabha was aggressively lobbying for nuclear weapons and made several speeches indian radio 1964 bhabha told the indian public via indian radio that such nuclear weapons are remarkably cheap and supported his arguments referring the economical cost american nuclear testing program plowshare had the tech prowess make work but our first test was done 1974 took years even after having everything ready make the announcement the nsg was founded response our tests may 1974 and first met november 1975 was created keep india out world nuclear power order they purposly made the distinction between members nws nuclear weapon states ratifers russia acceders china france and nnws non nuclear weapon states and kept 1st jan 1967 date apply this criteria china nuclear weapons tests took place 1964 and its first hydrogen bomb test occurred 1967 now china member nsg and blocking from getting the membership had conducted our tests before1st jan 1967 could have joined the nsg nws because decided wait and not announce our capabilities now have run behind nsg grant waivers and accept our membership but they want sign nnws nnws have agree let developing acquiring nuclear weapons all this because didn the test soon enough didn announce our capabilities what tomorrow these countries create another club and stop from going moon mars what they block creation anti sat weapons this why have make big announcement for our mars moon mission anti sat weapons have tell the world were here first ,1

congratulations all drdo scientists and defense personnel involved operation shakti ,0
 think was entirely appropriate for the address this remember the world also watching and this entirely new warfare capability that india has acquired nothing less than when india went nuclear remember when china did this for the first time and the entire world reacted very negatively the important part was not announcing that the operation took place maybe drdo iaf they handle this could done the important part was announcing the posture that the weapons will used for peaceful purposes and technological advancement only that the policy position that the world interested and like the first use policy for nukes only the should announce for credible ,1

 not sure what most you are confused with baldur died trying kill his mother \ which can considered battle noble act\ and she accepted hel doubt and that one the reasons freya threatens destroy kratos and parade his body all the realms magni the other hand died fighting which means \ probably\ went valhalla modi died cowards death fled the battle twice practically signed for eternity hel ,-1

some points gathered since 1999 the congress has had dynastic members parliament elected the lok sabha with the bjp not far behind with the 15th lok sabha beginning 2009 was the most ‘dynastic’ term yet comprising mps with family ties politicians percent the total lower house the number successful independent candidates lok sabha elections has fallen from peak 1957 more than three 2014 symptom the rising costs contesting elections though famously the state where all four generations the nehru gandhi family have held their constituencies the bjp has had the highest number dynasts power percent the longest serving dynasts have inherited their seat parliament whether long standing political dynasties have negative impact constituency hard determine ,1
 from the regional parties hold the sway never voted for dmk and wont future also reason being lawlessness extreme corruption family politics and main reason lived through the electricity scarcity years 2010 2011 the suffering experienced chennai due heat and humidity during those times made dmk hater the core have been neutral towards admk steadfastly voted nota after 2011 because admk became welfare party with high levels corruption after years this election may vote for admk bjp decision struggling because was planning for nota but recent announcements such basic pay poor reservation for women have shaken belief have seen the effects welfare people its like drug which can never taken away from budget surplus years ago because its extreme welfare heavy debt also upa rule was worst from coal cwg coal scams policy paralysis was dark period people also forget the npa growth and the high inflation from upa rule think congress present leaders dont have any good plans for the growth the country their main plank has been farm loan waivers and ubi schemes bjp has been arrogant for the last years think they get another chance mostly will coalition government they cant make stupid decisions like demonetization also the communal jibes will die down because coalition government you are answerable many parties with minority interests ,1

 think one place start would read the parties manifestoes that way you least escape the media spin have the impression right now that all simply caught our echo chambers and trying make sense the parties based that citizens think the very least should read the manifestos see what vision the parties have and whether you find them line with your vision the future course many people will say they lying anyway but think not many the vajpayee governments later policies were clearly stated their manifesto the entire political vision manmohan singh was stated him very clear and simple language interview with nyt him 2004 and retrospect you see that that exactly the broad idea followed for the next years any case reading the manifestos makes more sense than simply taking defeatist view and saying doesn matter anyway very senior politician met when was still relatively unknown told that even there corruption politics doesn mean that politicians don have vision for the nation let look for that vision the lack and make the best choices that can thinking citizens the biggest democracy the world ,1

 will give you example from outside india 70s snp was rooting for independence while the labour government led callaghan was not supporting full independence they were sympathetic towards more power devolution scots that effect there was proposal that became law create scottish parliament referendum meets certain conditions while the referendum won did not meet few other criteria the labour govt did not could not implement the devolution snp moved confidence motion which the labour government lost one vote brought coservatives power they repealed the law and did not agree for devolution labour party did not comeback power for next years the next referndum for scottish parliament was held 1997 years later another labour government the learning here you would have decide which one you would think better less evil then hold your nose and vote for there probable third party candidate that can win and better ,1

 don think all legitimate raise congress lack political courage over the sabarimala issue the level hindutva that actually quite ridiculous was political calculation the bjp affinity for hindutva not political ideological reservation the most political and least meaningful issues affects only government jobs which make what percentage the jobs economy again for gifts yeah that quite pathetic and almost every single party the country does some way the other but neither loan waivers nor minimum income fall into that category those are both schemes with legitimate policy arguments behind them the congress itself admits that farm loan waivers are bad idea not sustainable solution they pitching some sort economic band aid emergency relief the people badly affected the current government anti poor policies and much they try dress populist jumlas the findamental basis modinomics good old right wing economics which the same around the world trickle down economy which well known not work and end widening the wealth gap the basic minimum income actually not novel idea there are countries where this already happens and actually quite effective but country our size has tried yet and probably less effective than hope but policy the right direction yes every alternative has flaws but when one the two major players seems have maleficent agenda lesser the two evils becomes very understated way describing the difference between the two sides isn small ideologically inclined one party isn farfetched fear radical abrogation the most basic fundamental values the idea india ,1

here the thing about meritocracy when you systematically subdue particular section society creating multiple hurdles their socio educational advancement you are rewarded with less competition for the sought after jobs and seats educational institutes since the said sections society are longer able compete against you this like breaking the legs your opponent before the race that you can later win the race merit what affirmative action does removes the disability imposed that particular section society reserving fair share seats for example what proportion seats would have been occupied scs who constitute the population had they not been treated like dirt for thousands years yes exactly what proportion would have been occupied women had they been treated like actual human beings with actual brains exactly before you start guessing let tell you general category male and support not but seats for women both jobs education and parliament assemblies real meritocracy everyone should able compete without the disabilities imposed them society compared the privileged sections when compete for job with others don want take seat which would have otherwise gone woman but got that seat just because society thinks men are more meritorious the reservation based economic criteria sure dubious almost entire india earns less than 8lpa 8lpa poor then mukesh ambani middle class ,1

actually did any party say that don think what happened was that bjp and modi bombast was over instant from chest thumping and bravado was sheepishness and silence they probably thought other parties were asking when will abhinandan return the question always there the air one has ask the embarrassment that makes them feel like the question was asked next even were asked big deal there are different routes patriotism the current government fucking the country that patriotic sentiment whether the government power upa nda bjp definitely subscribed when they were opposition none this really matters bjp and its fans modi and his fans know its all about scoring goals absolutely does not matter them whether its right wrong whether its factual incorrect whether there are other interpretations statement which should given value etc after all those are liberal sentiments and values for the right these are just tools objective ,-1
don you think will again win this elections maybe very small margin look social media has scores blind supporters have highly educated the students from elite colleges friends telling that dictatorship under modi better for india these people have shown love for hitler and hate for ghandhi openly justification there immense hate against minorities the name minority appeasement social media circles fake news being prominent ones although the people with phones and access social media won decide our future but the poorer sections society especially rural will the most probable outcome will inc winning most south maharashtra going bjp they work good here most central states where bjp recently lost may still north east swing with the nrc bengal will turn out bjp the atrocities done mamta the name secularism further north will also bjp delhi can aap for the developments have heard maybe seen punjab haryana too feel sad for country for where heading was the same country ancestors fought for side side with every honourable indian against the oppressive rule only end like this hands people who were and are busy plotting terrorism murder back then ,1

namaskaram ente bhaarya malayali aanu agree with everything you’ said bjp kerala hopeless because the state leadership believe they put sreedharan pillai because was rather neutral face not part any faction factionalism has ruined bjp kerala the current faces the state unit surendran probably the most deserving and has done the most see even congress and cpm folks saying positive things about him kummanam simple guy and hard working but has too much connect with the rss and the hindu orgs rss wants him the party face overall think bjp ought get its marketing right kerala sabarimala gave good platform but taking local issues appealing nris building the development image like how they’ done karnataka and raising interesting faces will bring results also modi never compared kerala somalia said that kerala’ tribals have high imr higher than india’ average his statement was twisted and misinterpreted the left ,1

the point you make very valid bjp has dearth good candidates kerala and they haven had good presence there until now good leaders not come until the party has presence and the party does not have presence until good candidates fight for them its chicken and egg game you vote for them today the quality local leadership will improve time goes ,1

the most basic point which people forget before beringing 2004 like retards that 1999 was not 2014 inc vote share was actually higher than bjp even 1999 bjp was much lower than what and they had won mere 180 seats 1999 2004 bjp had lost multiple state elections and failed expand their base states they lost elections maharashtra bihar and they were still not even contest karnataka west bengal the only major state elections that they won were gujarat and state elections rajasthan and chattisgarh the former was only because modi and godhra and the latter because anti incumbency finally paying off,-1
 tmc their only hope forming govt and doubt mamata going just let the congress form government and play second fiddle especially she sweeps bengal ,0
the issue isn that congress will get those seats the issue that bjp won get near majority and the major beneficiaries will the regional parties congress can register meaningful gains only raj and guj best case maybe little haryana and they can get past 130 140 even the most favourable scenario worst case scenario for bjp losing seats bsp and another congress above mentioned states and meaningful gains eastern india ,1
many more such factors all from 2009 2009 cong itself won seats partner rld won totalling seats they would lucky get this year that loss seats rajasthan was rout cong got seats bjp given how close the state elections were and this with incumbeny this year even optimistically they would lucky cross all seats that loss you said was seats digression why the crazy chuths keep voting cong this year telengana combined they might get seats assuming cbn allies with cong lax that loss seats assam they had lucky get this year that lost haryana they swept seats even assuming half that seats loss maha was another biggie along with ncp they won lucky get half again this year loss seats just these states alone result loss odd seats that they can win matter what and these are the upper predictions from the upa tally 262 knock off these and you get 190 best take power they will need another seats this means khichdi parties say very optimistically momta jihad bannerjee with another and they are still seats short maybe bjd coughs best luck with stability even choosing who will would shitshow and govt would collapse within year and these are all hyper optimistic projections realistically the upa would close maybe 120 seats the third front 200 odd and the rest going the nda ,1

 really don understand this attitude treating indian comedians the scum the earth while revering american comedians gods and always the same names brought compare imagine every tech startup was compared google and disparaged for not being good google have you seen comedians america apart from carlin and chappelle you know how many comedians are active apart from them you know how good each their jokes are are they all universally excellent the indian stand comedy scene suffers from both lack participants and lack audience growing and still finding its legs and here have people comparing the best the business and pretending they are too sophisticated for such mediocre comedy get your head out your ass regarding the variety indian comics there are people who comment variety issues with their own style you don like kenny sebastien style there are plenty other comics for you try out but bet you can even vocalize what kind comedy you like you just want name drop david chappelle and act woke about comedy indian comedians dividing india how warped your world view that this what you think think admirable that comedians are finally finding the courage speak freely regarding politics without fears repercussion good humour involves making observations about things people never thought vocalize and doing comedians make confront uncomfortable truths you don like how they change the system like this divide file rti public service rather than sitting front your computer wasting time insulting people who tell jokes for living comicstaan was judged panel some india most successful stand comedians the time vouch for their credibility over couch warrior like you any time they chose sejal because she was good and had the potential entertaining you say you found her unfunny can you even vocalize why are you just another guy whining about women talking about their periods and harassment you complaining about people trying show off their wokeness but you doing the same with this post trying show how even more woke you are than those wannabe woke people stop trying belittle people and talk about the stand comedians you actually like for change point out what you liked about them and what you felt could better there nothing woke about tearing people down ,1
